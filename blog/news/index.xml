        &lt;p&gt;There will be six Jenkins X talks given by various speakers at the first-ever &lt;a href=&#34;https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cdcon/&#34;&gt;CDCon&lt;/a&gt; on October 7-8. The two-day virtual event, hosted by the Continuous Delivery Foundation, will focus on improving the world&amp;rsquo;s capacity to deliver software with security and speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cdcon/&#34;&gt;Register&lt;/a&gt; to attend the virtual event for only 25 USD and get access to all of the following Jenkins X talks and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wednesday-october-7&#34;&gt;Wednesday, October 7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cdcon2020.sched.com/event/dpvW/a-cicd-framework-for-production-machine-learning-at-massive-scale-using-jenkins-x-and-seldon-core-alejandro-saucedo-seldon&#34;&gt;A CI/CD Framework for Production Machine Learning at Massive Scale (using Jenkins X and Seldon Core)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Speaker:&lt;/strong&gt; Alejandro Saucedo, Seldon
&lt;strong&gt;Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 1:15 PM PDT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing production machine learning systems as internal data science infrastructure requirements grow, has uncovered new challenges which have required fundamentally different approaches to that of traditional CI/CD in software engineering. In this talk we will dive into the work we are doing at the SIG-MLOps and the CD Foundation towards developing the methodologies that encompass best practices to continuously integrate and deploy machine learning in production at massive scale. In this talk, we&amp;rsquo;ll provide key insights on the core MLOps concepts, as well as a hands-on coding example where we take a text classification model through its training, deployment and promotion as canary and shadow deployments, which will also allow us to get deeper and more specific insight on our production environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cdcon2020.sched.com/event/dpvQ/dailymotions-continuous-delivery-story-vincent-behar-dailymotion&#34;&gt;Dailymotion&amp;rsquo;s Continuous Delivery Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Speaker:&lt;/strong&gt; Vincent Behar, Dailymotion
&lt;strong&gt;Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 3:30 PM PDT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, Vincent will share Dailymotion&amp;rsquo;s Continuous Delivery story with Jenkins, Jenkins X and Tekton. He will come back on the initial state and issues faced on the CI/CD topic, and how it was solved. He will insist on the practices that were put in place and the benefits that resulted from switching to Jenkins X. He will conclude with the new challenges brought by improving Dailymotion&amp;rsquo;s Continuous Delivery platform. If you are wondering if Jenkins X is the right tool for you, and the impact it can have on your team(s), then this is the right session for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;thursday-october-8&#34;&gt;Thursday, October 8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cdcon2020.sched.com/event/e2NG/moving-from-jenkins-to-jenkins-x-scaling-and-accelerating-cicd-dr-michael-garbade-education-ecosystem&#34;&gt;Moving from Jenkins to Jenkins X: Scaling and Accelerating CI/CD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Speaker:&lt;/strong&gt; Dr Michael Garbade, Education Ecosystem
&lt;strong&gt;Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 12:00 PM PDT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins has served as a continuous integration (CI) tool long before the emergence of Kubernetes and distributed systems running on cloud-native platforms.
Working with Jenkins as a stand-alone open-source tool has proved to be extremely difficult for distributed systems engineers, as it is designed for small projects and not scalable to bigger projects.
Jenkins X has emerged as a way to both improve and automate continuous delivery pipelines to Kubernetes and cloud-native environments.
In this talk, we will discuss the limitations of Jenkins, how Jenkins X addresses those limitations, how it leverages open source and commercial CI/CD tools for easier bug fixes, faster deployments, stability, consistency and improved communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cdcon2020.sched.com/event/dpvc/enable-a-pipeline-as-code-capability-for-12000-developers-jimmy-mcnamara-fidelity-investments&#34;&gt;Enable a Pipeline As Code Capability for 12,000 Developers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Speaker:&lt;/strong&gt; Jimmy McNamara, Fidelity Investments
&lt;strong&gt;Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 1:00 PM PDT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aoife Fitzmaurice and Jimmy McNamara take us through a journey on how Fidelity Investments plans to roll out a Pipeline As Code capability to 12,000 developers. Leveraging cloud-based Kubernetes platforms to ensure best operational outcomes the team is driven to enable this best practice capability across Fidelity. This capability is key to assisting the growth of both an inner-sourcing and open-sourcing culture throughout the firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cdcon2020.sched.com/event/dqON/gitops-and-secrets-kara-de-la-marck-cloudbees&#34;&gt;GitOps and Secrets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Speaker:&lt;/strong&gt; Kara de la Marck, CloudBees
&lt;strong&gt;Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 1:00 PM PDT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitOps uses Git as the “single source of truth” for declarative infrastructure and enables developers to manage infrastructure with the same Git pull requests they use to manage a codebase. Having all configuration files version-controlled by Git has many advantages, but best practices for securely managing secrets with GitOps remain contested. Join us in this presentation about GitOps and secret management. Attendees will learn about the pros and cons of various approaches and why the Jenkins X project has chosen to standardize on Kubernetes external secrets for secret management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cdcon2020.sched.com/event/dpvT/kubernetes-chaos-engineering-with-chaos-toolkit-and-jenkins-x-viktor-farcic-cloudbees&#34;&gt;Kubernetes Chaos Engineering With Chaos Toolkit and Jenkins X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Speaker:&lt;/strong&gt; Viktor Farcic, CloudBees
&lt;strong&gt;Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 3:15 PM PDT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing more satisfying than being able to destroy things without consequences is to be awarded for destruction. If you do have destructive tendencies, but you&amp;rsquo;d like to convert them into something positive, chaos engineering might be just the thing you need. We&amp;rsquo;ll explore through a hands-on demo on how to use Chaos Toolkit to define and run chaos experiments inside a Kubernetes cluster with Istio. We&amp;rsquo;ll see a few use-cases of potential problems that can be detected and solved. We&amp;rsquo;ll automate the deployment of chaos experiments using Jenkins X and make them an integral part of our continuous delivery pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;register-for-cdcon&#34;&gt;Register for CDCon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t miss out on these great talks. &lt;a href=&#34;https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cdcon/&#34;&gt;Register for CDCon&lt;/a&gt; to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blog: Octant: the OSS UI for Jenkins X</title>
      <link>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/08/06/octant-jx/</link>

      <guid>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/08/06/octant-jx/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;A common question we have heard in the community over the years is &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/docs/resources/faq/config/#is-there-a-ui-available-for-jenkins-x&#34;&gt;Is there an open source UI for Jenkins X?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well we now have an answer: its &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/octant&#34;&gt;Octant&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/octant-jx&#34;&gt;octant-jx&lt;/a&gt; plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-octant&#34;&gt;Why Octant?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We love &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/octant&#34;&gt;Octant&lt;/a&gt; because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;open source and very easy to extend with plugins in Go or TypeScript/JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lets you visualise and work with all kubernetes and custom resources across multiple clusters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/octant-jx&#34;&gt;octant-jx&lt;/a&gt;  has awesome integration with Jenkins X components like apps, environments, pipelines, repositories etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;features&#34;&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longer term we&amp;rsquo;re planning on making most of the developer and operations features of Jenkins X available through the UI via &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/octant-jx&#34;&gt;octant-jx&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e.g. we hope as part of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/enhancements/issues/36&#34;&gt;Jenkins X 3.x&lt;/a&gt; you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to install or upgrade Jenkins X and watch the installation proceed all via Octant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But already right now today you can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;view applications, environments, pipelines, repositories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for a pipeline quickly navigate to:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;its Pod, Log, Pull Request or Preview Environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for each step you can view the step detail or log of the step&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;see the various jobs and pipelines used to operate Jenkins X itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;over time will add management UI capabilities for installing, upgrading and administering Jenkins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find out &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/octant#usage&#34;&gt;more about installing and using Octant here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;demo&#34;&gt;Demo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did a &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/Njl247hjRuU?t=186&#34;&gt;demo of octant-jx&lt;/a&gt; at the last &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/community/office_hours/&#34;&gt;office hours&lt;/a&gt;. We also &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njl247hjRuU&amp;amp;t=2027s&#34;&gt;presented octant-jx&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://octant.dev/community/&#34;&gt;octant office hours this week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LCPHi0BnUg&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&#34;&gt;demo video showing octant in action with Jenkins X&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blog: CJXD to upstream Jenkins X to the future</title>
      <link>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/07/29/cjxdtoupstreamjxtofuture/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 29 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/07/29/cjxdtoupstreamjxtofuture/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;CJXD was first introduced at the end of July 2019 with the aim to provide a more stable version of Jenkins X that was under heavy development.  The release cadence was reduced to one per month, the upgrade process well tested and a large focus on stability issues was taken on.  It is fair to say that this was not only expected but absolutely needed by users of Jenkins X to service their own software delivery. A little over a year on we are now in a better place, following the improvements above means we are now able to focus all attention back towards the upstream Jenkins X and look towards where Jenkins X needs to go next.  There is still much to do, areas which require attention in design, upgrades related to other projects and innovation to explore.  With that, the need for CJXD over and above using upstream Jenkins X is reduced.  CloudBees will stop releasing CJXD builds and focus purely upstream and it’s engineering efforts towards working with the OSS community on JX3 Alpha, Beta, GA and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JX3 is in a relatively early stage, we have an enhancement issue &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/enhancements/issues/36&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and plan to start showing some initial developments and design docs to help people get involved in the next week or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the OSS community works on getting JX3 to GA, users of CJXD have a few options.  Both option 1 and 2 below involve moving to the stable upstream JX2.  One important note here is you will need to remove the Jenkins X UI as this a CloudBees specific offering and will not continue in favour of the new extensible OSS UI powered by Octant.  This was demo’d at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/Njl247hjRuU&#34;&gt;recent office hours&lt;/a&gt; as well as discussing some next steps we are working through for JX3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Upgrade your existing CJXD installation to upstream JX2.  There are some steps on how to do this below, there may be some edge cases in doing this but as in all the options here the OSS community in on hand to help &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/community/&#34;&gt;https://jenkins-x.io/community/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notes:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will continue to be able to apply JX2 upgrades.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No backwards compatible upgrade for Vault if you are using it.  The migration configuration steps below will omit Vault from this and future upgrades.  Note for JX3 we are working on using external secrets as an abstraction above lots of secret store implementations.  So for now we recommend keeping on the Vault Operator 0.4.16 release and manage the Vault upgrade along with the JX 3 external secrets work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Create a brand new JX2 cluster and jx import your git repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Stay on CJXD and wait to move to JX3 although the timelines for this are unknown it is the primary development focus going forward so lots more details on this coming soon.  Note you won’t be able to upgrade to obtain future JX 2 fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jenkins X OSS community is very active on Slack, we host regular open office hours zoom sessions and are building out a number of special interest groups in the coming weeks and months which we would love for you to be a part of.  Twitter is active and a good way to keep up to date with events, plus we are launching a new Discourse community forum.  There is no better time to be involved, if you are looking to contribute code, learn or share new things or help carve out the future direction of Jenkins X, we are eager for your involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a start please come and say hello on the slack channel or be brave and help kick off &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkinsx.discourse.group/&#34;&gt;https://jenkinsx.discourse.group/&lt;/a&gt; - you just need to sign up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to seeing you soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;migration-steps-for-cjxd-to-upstream-jenkins-x&#34;&gt;Migration steps for CJXD to upstream Jenkins X&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;configuration-changes&#34;&gt;Configuration changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get the latest jx CLI &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases&#34;&gt;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change version stream, boot config repos URL + tags, remove Jenkins X UI and remove the upgrade for Vault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change the git repository for your development environment, get the URL using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; jx get environments
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;and apply these changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remove the &lt;code&gt;env/jx-app-ui&lt;/code&gt; folder and &lt;code&gt;jx-app-ui&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;env/requirements.yaml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remove the &lt;code&gt;jx step boot vault&lt;/code&gt; boot pipeline step&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;switch from the CJXD version stream to the upstream Jenkins X one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact changes described above can be found in this commit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cb-kubecd/environment-cjxdtest1-dev/commit/2596efdb51b812758ce847e16beb2035af4f61f1&#34;&gt;https://github.com/cb-kubecd/environment-cjxdtest1-dev/commit/2596efdb51b812758ce847e16beb2035af4f61f1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once these changes are merged into the mainline branch follow the boot pipeline using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; jx get build logs
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the boot pipeline has finished successfully you can upgrade to the very latest release (the git sha’s above are the latest at writing this blog)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; jx upgrade boot
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Review and /approve the generated pull request, follow the boot pipeline logs to success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run into problems, need any help or guidance please ask in the the Jenkins X community &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/community/&#34;&gt;https://jenkins-x.io/community/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blog: Consolidate the use of Apps / Addons - Coding Phase 2</title>
      <link>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/07/27/gsoc2020/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/07/27/gsoc2020/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The coding phase 2 of Google Summer of Code will end this week, so I&amp;rsquo;d like to share my coding phase 2 work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The addons have been migrated to apps on coding phase 1, but these apps have not been hosted to OSS, so during the coding phase 2, Jenkins X team build OSS cluster to host my apps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x-apps/jx-app-flagger&#34;&gt;jx-app-flagger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x-apps/jx-app-ingress&#34;&gt;jx-app-ingress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x-apps/jx-app-gloo&#34;&gt;jx-app-gloo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x-apps/jx-app-ingress&#34;&gt;jx-app-kubeless&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you can use &lt;code&gt;jx add app&lt;/code&gt; command to install the above apps, I also made a number of PR:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/pull/7472&#34;&gt;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/pull/7472&lt;/a&gt; - fix &lt;code&gt;jx add app&lt;/code&gt; command&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/pull/7441&#34;&gt;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/pull/7441&lt;/a&gt; - fix skip dir when looping Helm templates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/pull/7440&#34;&gt;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/pull/7440&lt;/a&gt; - deprecate create addon kubeless&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/pull/7436&#34;&gt;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/pull/7436&lt;/a&gt; - support &lt;code&gt;jx add app&lt;/code&gt; from git repository&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My work is inseparable from my mentors and Jenkins X team, in particular, my mentor -  Kara de la Marck took good care of me in every way (such as language, English is my second language), so thank you for your time ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;next-phase-work&#34;&gt;Next phase work&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next phase I will write these apps document and add deprecate note to jx, and continue to explore apps. I will also follow up about apps/addons issues on jx then try to solve the issues. Jenkins X team is going to be releasing 3.x of Jenkins X, I also need to get familiar with it - &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/octant-jx&#34;&gt;https://github.com/jenkins-x/octant-jx&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The coding phase 1 of Google Summer of Code ended last week, I&amp;rsquo;m working on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2020/projects/jenkins-x-apps-consolidation/&#34;&gt;Consolidate the use of Apps / Addons&lt;/a&gt;, so I&amp;rsquo;d like to share my coding phase 1 work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the project, I mainly migrate addons to apps, the way is easier for improve jx apps and addons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the time, I&amp;rsquo;ve migrated all addons to apps via Helm chart way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is my make apps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nodece/jx-app-kubeless&#34;&gt;https://github.com/nodece/jx-app-kubeless&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nodece/jx-app-owasp-zap&#34;&gt;https://github.com/nodece/jx-app-owasp-zap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nodece/jx-app-flagger&#34;&gt;https://github.com/nodece/jx-app-flagger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nodece/jx-app-gloo&#34;&gt;https://github.com/nodece/jx-app-gloo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nodece/jx-app-istio&#34;&gt;https://github.com/nodece/jx-app-istio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nodece/jx-app-ingress&#34;&gt;https://github.com/nodece/jx-app-ingress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current, we only move to jx-app-kubeless to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x-apps&#34;&gt;jenkins-x-apps&lt;/a&gt; repository, other apps haven&amp;rsquo;t been moved to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x-apps&#34;&gt;jenkins-x-apps&lt;/a&gt; repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can visit &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k2KEMdk5-9HrU-IUuataYD63Kl-JEsuy5aXus7Dcitc/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;next-phase-work&#34;&gt;Next phase work&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next phase is to add &lt;code&gt;jx delete app&lt;/code&gt; command to jx, but it has been implemented by Jenkins X contributor, so I made a new plan for next phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is my plan for the next phase:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improve &lt;code&gt;jx add app&lt;/code&gt; - It will support to fetch any git repository to install app. I also consider migrate application to apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfect the work of phase 1, these apps haven&amp;rsquo;t moved to jenkins-x-apps repository yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow up on jx issues to improve jx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;demo-for-coding-phase-1&#34;&gt;Demo for coding phase 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I presentation my coding phase 1 demo on YouTube lase week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes: the video language is Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ka2Uor_oTWc&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Jenkins hold a meeting for Jenkins GSoC students to present their phase 1 work, I also present my coding phase 1 work on the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/HQLhakpx5mk&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

      <title>Blog: Jenkins X &amp; Open Innovation </title>
      <link>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/07/08/jxopeninnovation/</link>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Jenkins X burst onto the CI/CD scene a couple of years ago - reimagining CI/CD on Kubernetes with pipeline automation, GitOps built-in and and preview environments to help teams collaborate and accelerate their software delivery at any scale. It has been evolving at a breakneck pace, keeping up with the changes in the wider Kubernetes ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the release of Helm 3, Jenkins X Labs nurtured an early experiment to adopt it. On May 15th, the primary sponsor of Jenkins X, CloudBees, &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/05/15/helm3/#why-isnt-this-all-more-open&#34;&gt;shared a post&lt;/a&gt; talking about the future direction of Helm 3 and Jenkins X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open source projects rise to ubiquity thanks to a virtuous cycle of technology and business adoption. It is a constant challenge to balance these concerns and delineate what is open source and what can be commercialized. In a fast-changing open source and tech landscape, sometimes the line gets drawn in the wrong place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jenkins X community is passionate and vocal and Mauricio Salatino, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/salaboy&#34;&gt;Salaboy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://salaboy.com/2020/05/19/why-isnt-jenkins-xs-future-more-open/&#34;&gt;shared a post&lt;/a&gt; strongly expressing his views on the new direction. The post was supported by a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/7207&#34;&gt;Github issue&lt;/a&gt; which allowed other community members to also share feedback on this topic. Many of CloudBees founders and leaders are veterans of open source projects. CloudBees is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.previous.cloudbees.com/open-source&#34;&gt;committed to open source&lt;/a&gt;. We demonstrate our commitment through deep involvement in open source projects and communities. So we took this feedback very seriously and listened to what the community was telling us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One line that stood out in Salatino&amp;rsquo;s post is this: &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Jenkins X is unlike any other project that I worked on in the past&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em&gt; This is significant, especially given how many OSS projects Salatino contributes to. Salatino continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The speed of changes in these projects is unprecedented and keeping up with all of it is a big challenge. Because of this, Jenkins X is more than a solution to a CI/CD problem, it is a shared community learning experience and a research project that pushes the boundaries of best practices for CI/CD in Kubernetes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X is a solution to a CI/CD problem, but it is more than that. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a shared community learning experience. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a research project that pushes the boundaries of best practices for CI/CD in Kubernetes. And the engine that powers all of this is the open source community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CI/CD right now is going through a renaissance with the onset of microservices, containers and cloud native technologies. The whole space is evolving rapidly. We have seen this earlier this year, with the rise of Tekton which was adopted as the main pipeline engine for Jenkins X. Jenkins X in a year&amp;rsquo;s time is likely to be very different than it is today.  At CloudBees, we believe open source drives innovation, leads to better, more robust technology and benefits everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are very grateful to Salatino and the wider community for graciously speaking up and giving feedback on how the project should evolve. With this in mind we want to play our part by ensuring Jenkins X future is open and innovative. You may have already noticed some of the changes, such as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/community/roadmap/&#34;&gt;open roadmap&lt;/a&gt; being discussed. Specifically, on Helm 3 we want this work to resume in the open as a community effort, in the form of a Jenkins X Helm 3 working group. These are just a couple of steps towards that north star of open innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X is unlike any other open source project out there, let&amp;rsquo;s keep pushing the boundaries of what&amp;rsquo;s possible - together and in the open.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blog: CloudBees contributions to Jenkins X - June 2020</title>
      <link>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/06/26/cjxd-june-20/</link>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/images/logo/cloudbees.png&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For everyone here at Cloudbees, June has been a really productive month and the release 11 of CJXD comes with a set of new available features and fixes for upstream Jenkins X, as well as a new version of the UI that we are really excited to release!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding Jenkins X new features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Hardy Ferentschik, you can now bring your own Vault to your Jenkins X cluster. It will allow you to use an already existing Vault instance to store your Jenkins X secrets, checkout the documentation &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/docs/install-setup/installing/boot/secrets/#external&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. He also improved the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/docs/reference/components/vault/#accessing-secrets&#34;&gt;existing documentation&lt;/a&gt; to help you access and manage your secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can’t find a Buildpack that suits your projects in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x-buildpacks/jenkins-x-kubernetes&#34;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of available ones, Adam Magan has been working on allowing you to use your own custom buildpacks, please find the documentation &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/docs/create-project/build-packs/#using-custom-build-packs&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the CloudBees UI, the team is happy to make available some really useful features in a new Preview version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now create a new project from a list of available “quickstarts” that you can use as a template and that will be pre configured to work with Jenkins X. If you want to get started with projects, please check the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-jenkins-x-distribution/latest/user-interface/projects&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have an existing project that you want to manage using Jenkins X, you can now also use the UI to import it in your cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UI is now exposed with its own URL and protected by basic authentication. Please check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-jenkins-x-distribution/latest/user-interface/install&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; to have more details about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the team continues to fix the issues reported by the community, since the previous release, over 30 issues has been closed, with the goal of making Jenkins X always more reliable.
Special thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ankitm123&#34;&gt;ankitm123&lt;/a&gt; who is really involved in the community and has been fixing a lot of issues in this release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have a couple of things in progress that will come soon, be prepared for some exciting announcements around OpenShift support. Also Gitlab and Bitbucket Server support for Lighthouse are available in preview mode, if you want to give it a try, please check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/docs/install-setup/installing/boot/git-provider/#bitbucket-server&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;, we welcome feedback and bug reports !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it’s not done yet, feel free to start using the Cloudbees Jenkins X Distribution, all you need to know in order to have it up and running is &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-jenkins-x-distribution/latest/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; !&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blog: Lighthouse Goes GA!</title>
      <link>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/06/08/lighthouse-goes-ga/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/06/08/lighthouse-goes-ga/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;In May of this year, Jenkins X switched from using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow&#34;&gt;Prow&lt;/a&gt; as its default webhook handler to using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/lighthouse&#34;&gt;Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;. This is the result of almost a year of work, and provides some significant improvements for users of Jenkins X. You can find more information on the differences between Prow and Lighthouse &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/docs/reference/components/lighthouse/#comparisons-to-prow&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most notably, Jenkins X now properly supports GitHub Enterprise as well as github.com, with preview support for GitLab and BitBucket Server. Prow only supports github.com, so until now, Jenkins X users have had to jump through hoops or accept significant limitations to their workflows in order to use any other SCM (source control management) providers. Lighthouse is tested against every provider we list support for, including the preview support for GitLab and BitBucket Server. While some functionality may not behave exactly the same on all providers, the core functionality of &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/docs/build-test-preview/chatops/&#34;&gt;ChatOps&lt;/a&gt; should work on all. Lighthouse also has a smaller footprint in terms of resources and pods used in your Kubernetes cluster than Prow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in Jenkins X and Lighthouse support for other SCM providers, please let us know and we&amp;rsquo;ll see what we can do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-does-preview-support-mean&#34;&gt;What does &amp;ldquo;preview support&amp;rdquo; mean?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary difference between Lighthouse&amp;rsquo;s support for GitHub and GitHub Enterprise, and its support for GitLab and BitBucket Server, is testing and usage. The Jenkins X project itself uses Lighthouse heavily, so we&amp;rsquo;re very confident in its behavior and reliability with the GitHub API. Its GitLab and BitBucket Server support is tested with every change to the project, but until we&amp;rsquo;ve had reports of Lighthouse users on GitLab or BitBucket Server in real-world usage, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to give the impression that support for those providers is known to be as stable as on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;rsquo;re using Jenkins X and Lighthouse with GitLab or BitBucket Server, we&amp;rsquo;d love to hear how your experience has been, &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/community/&#34;&gt;on our Slack channels or at our weekly office hours&lt;/a&gt;. If you run into in any problems with Lighthouse on any provider, whether it&amp;rsquo;s in preview or otherwise, please &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/lighthouse/issues&#34;&gt;open an issue&lt;/a&gt; and we&amp;rsquo;ll look into it as soon as possible. Once we&amp;rsquo;ve gotten enough feedback to be confident that major changes will not be needed for GitLab or for BitBucket Server, we&amp;rsquo;ll move those providers out of preview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;differences-between-providers&#34;&gt;Differences between providers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;github-and-github-enterprise&#34;&gt;GitHub and GitHub Enterprise&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There should be no functional differences between Lighthouse&amp;rsquo;s behavior on github.com vs a GitHub Enterprise instance. The exact same APIs are used in both cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;gitlab&#34;&gt;GitLab&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lighthouse with GitLab may be more likely to hit API rate limits, due to GitLab&amp;rsquo;s GraphQL functionality not matching the particular capabilities of GitHub, but the overall functionality is the same. There is one significant difference with GitLab, however. Some of Lighthouse&amp;rsquo;s ChatOps commands, such as &lt;code&gt;/approve&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/assign&lt;/code&gt;, overlap with &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/quick_actions.html&#34;&gt;GitLab quick actions&lt;/a&gt;, and currently, GitLab &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/215934&#34;&gt;does not trigger webhook events for quick actions&lt;/a&gt;. If Lighthouse does not receive a webhook event, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any way of knowing that a ChatOps command has been invoked. Therefore, we have added the ability to invoke &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/docs/build-test-preview/chatops/#chatops-commands&#34;&gt;all Lighthouse ChatOps commands&lt;/a&gt; either with the traditional &lt;code&gt;/approve&lt;/code&gt; etc command, or by adding a &lt;code&gt;lh-&lt;/code&gt; prefix, like &lt;code&gt;/lh-approve&lt;/code&gt;. When using Lighthouse with GitLab, you will want to use the &lt;code&gt;/lh-(whatever)&lt;/code&gt; commands to ensure that your command is actually processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that Lighthouse should work with gitlab.com and relatively current versions of GitLab Community Edition and GitLab Enterprise Edition, based on the API docs, but if you encounter any problems on GitLab CE or GitLab EE, please open an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;bitbucket-server&#34;&gt;BitBucket Server&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we should note that Lighthouse will not work properly with BitBucket Server versions earlier than 7.0. &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/bitbucket-server-7-0-release-notes-990546638.html#BitbucketServer7.0releasenotes-Anewwebhookforsourcebranchupdatesinapullrequest&#34;&gt;A new webhook was added in 7.0&lt;/a&gt; to be sent when the source branch for a pull request has been updated, because of a new commit, rebase, or similar changes, and without that webhook, Lighthouse isn&amp;rsquo;t informed in those cases and doesn&amp;rsquo;t know to rebuild the pull request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, &lt;a href=&#34;https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BCLOUD-11976&#34;&gt;due to BitBucket Server not having the concept of labels for pull requests&lt;/a&gt;, Lighthouse emulates labels by creating a comment on pull requests containing a table of labels for the pull request in question. This comment needs to remain in the consistent format Lighthouse creates or it won&amp;rsquo;t be able to detect the labels correctly. Comment formatting for BitBucket Server is also more limited than for GitHub or GitLab, so comments may be a bit awkward in their appearance at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blog: An update on helm 3 and JXL</title>
      <link>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/05/15/helm3/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/05/15/helm3/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-next-for-jxl-and-helm-3&#34;&gt;What’s next for JXL and Helm 3?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months back, we unveiled JXL to the Jenkins X community and framed it as a new thing, Jenkins X Labs, that would build out experimental features and test potential new things. Some would stick and go upstream into Jenkins X, others would be killed off as interesting but unsuccessful experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a new thing for Jenkins X, trying to better separate the experimentation loop from the increasingly stable and relied-upon upstream. And, to a degree it worked great - the JXL workaround helm 3 was awesome, and got a lot of excitement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where it didn’t work so great, though, was on what happened next. While this may be a bit forgivable since the whole thing was itself a new experiment for our community, it’s pretty clear we’ve dropped the ball a bit and that’s informing our next steps now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-did-we-learn-from-jxl&#34;&gt;What did we learn from jxl?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks back, we made it known that the JXL experiment was over. Specifically, the current jxl binary was over - not the idea of labs or any experiments, but the specific helm 3 experiment packaged into the current version of jxl had gotten us the info we needed to make some decisions about how we wanted to steer Jenkins X going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two main things we learned as a result of the jxl work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it was mostly a success. The direction was exciting, and helmfile is a huge help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the scope of the change was enormous. Getting the change to be production-ready, to the increasing quality standards being established by the CloudBees Jenkins X Distribution, was even larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note here that regressing in terms of quality and reliability is not an option - we’ve heard loud and clear from the community that Jenkins X needs to be more stable and more dependable, and even exciting changes can’t compose the progress we’re making on those fronts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with those takeaways in mind, we declared the helm 3 JXL experiment complete and got to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-whats-next-for-helm-3-and-jenkins-x&#34;&gt;So, what’s next for helm 3 and Jenkins X?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear upfront: Jenkins X will get helm 3. We are working on that now internally at CloudBees. And, specifically, we are working on a way to introduce this large change iteratively, over time, with safe upgrade paths and no sudden breaking changes. For bleeding-edge people, maybe that’s slower than you might prefer - but after the volume of feedback around stability, we’re playing it safe on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you might ask next where you can find that work. And the answer, to be honest, is that right now you can’t. With the work we do on Jenkins X at CloudBees, we aspire to be as consistently open and upstream as possible, but there are times when keeping our heads down to workshop things is the right path. The UI so far is one example of this, and for the time being helm 3 is another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;can-you-get-involved-in-helm-3-at-all&#34;&gt;Can you get involved in helm 3 at all?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in the work going on regarding Jenkins X and helm 3, we are looking for pilot users who want to test drive what’s in progress and give feedback once it&amp;rsquo;s ready. It’s not all of JXL, like I said it’s iterative and this is phase 1. Please get in touch if you’d like to discuss it more, either by email (&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:jx-feedback@cloudbees.com&#34;&gt;jx-feedback@cloudbees.com&lt;/a&gt;) or just in the community Slack (ping &lt;em&gt;vfarcic&lt;/em&gt; and he’ll get you on the list for feedback.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-isnt-this-all-more-open&#34;&gt;Why isn’t this all more open?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing we learned as part of doing JXL is that Jenkins X is not yet built well for safe experimentation. We want to fix that long term, and if we were doing it over again we’d likely handle jxl differently because of the unfortunate silence you’re now hearing from us after such exciting work, but like all corporate sponsors of open source projects, we have to balance priorities and one of the major ones is making Jenkins X high quality enough for large companies to use at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long term, as things continue to improve, we hope all experimentation can be done upstream without major issues - but we’re not there yet. And, continuing to build out on JXL risked a forking situation where the path back to upstream becomes harder and harder - we didn’t want that to happen. So, our solution for now, suboptimal as it is, is to build the next chapter out a little more privately, figure out what makes sense in upstream from day 1 and what we might want to first offer through the Distribution as an enterprise capability (similar to the UI) and then get the community back on track with a single direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re not saying this is great - it’s a learning process for us too, and while we’re excited about the path to the future JXL has given us, we also have to make the best of it with the limitations that exist today and the large companies trying to count on Jenkins X more and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;feedback-and-questions&#34;&gt;Feedback and questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d love to hear from you on this and discuss it more, so please ping us in the community Slack, join office hours and get involved. The Jenkins X community is critical to all of us and, even with some setbacks and missteps, we’re excited to keep learning and improving together.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blog: CloudBees contributions to Jenkins X - April 2020</title>
      <link>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/04/29/cjxd-april-20/</link>

        &lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/images/logo/cloudbees.png&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges of this particular time in the world it amazes me how members of the Jenkins X community continue to rise up and generously contribute to the project.  This month&amp;rsquo;s CJXD release is with no lack of upstream community contributions, thus I&amp;rsquo;m kicking off this blog with a very sincere THANK YOU to the contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of folks here at CloudBees continue to focus on Jenkins X stability and supportability.  In parallel, other folks are focused on new features and expanding support for additional platforms.  In an effort to help us continue these efforts, we completed the plan to remove code for Jenkins static masters in favor of going full-on with Tekton pipelines.  In addition, a number of unsupported commands scheduled for deprecation have now been removed from the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits of deprecating unsupported features and commands allows for more focus, clearer messaging, better documentation, better quality, faster development of new features, and expanding Kubernetes provider support.  You can learn more about our decision to remove traditional Jenkins masters &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/03/11/tekton/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month&amp;rsquo;s CJXD release continues to add value with stability improvements as well as some minor enhancements.  A total of &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/release-notes/latest/cloudbees-jenkins-x-distribution/v9&#34;&gt;38 relevant issues&lt;/a&gt; have been addressed since the previous release.  Over &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aapproved+closed%3A2020-03-29..2020-04-29+&#34;&gt;40 total upstream pull requests&lt;/a&gt; were merged since the previous release and all of them have been absorbed in to this CJXD release.  Community members submitted 10 of these PR&amp;rsquo;s and we greatly appreciate these contributions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead to the upcoming CJXD release in May, a good deal of energy over the past three months has been spent on several significant efforts which will begin to surface.  Without upsetting the product management team too much, I&amp;rsquo;ll just write about some of the things the engineering team is working on, BUT not necessarily what will be released or when&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lighthouse: Andrew Bayer took over completing James Strachan&amp;rsquo;s initial
stab at Lighthouse (Lighthouse is our very own lighter-weight Prow
substitute). Andrew has been working on it nearly full-time and it
really shows. Lighthouse is running great in our busy production
cluster and, well, keep your eye out upstream since I expect great
things VERY soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terraform: Hardy Ferentschik has been working diligently on an effort
to eventually remove cloud orchestration concerns from Jenkins X. As a
result we have some awesome new Terraform scripts for GKE and EKS
where you can prepare your cluster and then leverage &lt;code&gt;jx boot&lt;/code&gt; to
deploy Jenkins X. I anticipate official support for this in an
upcoming CJXD release, hopefully very soon. You can read more about
this in the upstream
&lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/docs/getting-started/&#34;&gt;Jenkins X Documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLI: Adam Magan did a huge amount of tedious work removing code for a
multitude of deprecated commands. Thankfully that is largely behind us
and Adam can move on to other more gratifying tasks. You can read more
about which commands were deprecated in the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/release-notes/latest/cloudbees-jenkins-x-distribution/v9#_deprecations_and_removals&#34;&gt;CJXD 9 Release Notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JX Labs: Dave Conde disappeared a couple weeks ago to work with James
Strachan and James Rawlings on something and I expect him to resurface
in several weeks. If he doesn&amp;rsquo;t return, I&amp;rsquo;ll be sending out a search
party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you have it.  Enjoy the release.  Please stay safe, take care of yourself, and take care of each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deane&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blog: Season of Docs 2020 📄</title>
      <link>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/04/28/season-of-docs-2020/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Apr 2020 11:44:25 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/04/28/season-of-docs-2020/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs&#34;&gt;Google Season of Docs&lt;/a&gt; fosters collaboration between open source projects and technical writers. This program brings the open source and technical writing communities together to improve documentation and increase awareness of open source. During the program, technical writers are given support in contributing to open source, information about the technical project to which they are contributing, and a stipend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X welcomes the opportunity to collaborate with technical writers on improving the Jenkins X documentation. We are excited to apply to participate in Google Season of Docs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/images/community/events/SeasonofDocs_Logo_.png&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;project-ideas&#34;&gt;Project Ideas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X invites technical writers to engage with our ongoing efforts to restructure and update the Jenkins X documentation. There are a number of ongoing projects, and technical writers are welcome to engage with them or to make their own proposals in any area of Jenkins X documentation. We welcome the experience and perspecitve of new contributors and encourage proposals based on a technical writer&amp;rsquo;s interests and expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refactor the existing documentation to provide an improved user experience or a more accessible information architecture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are currently in the process of restructuring the information architecture on the docs site. We recognise this is an iterative process and would welcome input from a technical writer on further improvements to create an accessible information architecture and improve the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improve our &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/community/documentation/&#34;&gt;contributor’s guide&lt;/a&gt; to ensure the information for new contributors is clear and well organised, including basic information about getting started as a contributor to Jenkins X, as well as any rules around licence agreements, processes for pull requests and reviews, building the project, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a tutorial for provisioning a Kubernetes cluster and installing Jenkins X with &lt;code&gt;jx boot&lt;/code&gt; on platforms that are not covered with Terraform. Currently, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/docs/getting-started/&#34;&gt;Get started page&lt;/a&gt; gives the incorrect impression that Jenkins X works only in GKE (Google Cloud Platform) and EKS (Amazon Web Services).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- * Write a how-to guide on using the new Terraform scripts to create Kubernetes clusters. Currently, on the docs site there is a [TODO for documentation on using Terraform to set up cloud resources](https://jenkins-x.io/docs/labs/boot/getting-started/cloud/terraform/). Using Terraform scripts to create clusters makes cluster creation more transparent and can increase default security. For more information on using Terraform scripts, please see a [recent office hours demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yujge0PHxd4) by [Hardy Ferentschik](https://github.com/hferentschik). --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build out &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/docs/getting-started/first-project/&#34;&gt;Creating Projects&lt;/a&gt; section to include new or extended sections such as Understanding Buildpacks, New Project With Quickstart Or Import, Defining Environments, etc. The GSoD writer would work with the Jenkins X engineering team and community to build out those pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create FAQs for select docs pages. The GSoD writer would read through our &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/community/#slack&#34;&gt;Kubernetes slack channels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed&#34;&gt;closed issues&lt;/a&gt; to identify the most common questions we are asked and to take the answers given to build out the FAQs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-important-dates&#34;&gt;📆 Important Dates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main part of Season of Docs runs for three months, from September to December 2020, but the application period for technical writers ends on July 9, 2020. &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/timeline&#34;&gt;Detailed GSoD Timeline can be found here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May 4, 2020: Deadline for Jenkins X to apply to Season of Docs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May 11 - June 8, 2020: Technical writers discuss project ideas with mentoring organisations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;July 9, 2020: Deadline for technical writer applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;September 14 - December 5, 2020: Technical writers work on their projects with guidance from mentors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-come-meet-us-and-ask-us-questions&#34;&gt;👋 Come meet us and ask us questions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We welcome technical writers to join our slack channels and our office hours. We&amp;rsquo;d be happy to answer your questions and guide you with your pull requests!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk to us on our slack channels, which are part of the Kubernetes slack. Join  Kubernetes slack &lt;a href=&#34;http://slack.k8s.io/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and find us on our channels:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blog: CloudBees contributions to Jenkins X - March 2020</title>
      <link>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/03/25/cjxd-march-20/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/03/25/cjxd-march-20/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/images/logo/cloudbees.png&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March has been a really busy month for us working on Jenkins X, several exciting projects are now well underway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently at office hours we discussed a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/enhancements/tree/master/proposals/3&#34;&gt;proposal to improve how we provision&lt;/a&gt; the cloud resources (storage buckets, service accounts &amp;amp; cryptographic keys) that Jenkins X requires.
The idea behind this enhancement is that some companies may require the infrastructure to be provisioned by a user (someone in operations perhaps) that requires a different set of permissions than the user that runs &lt;code&gt;jx boot&lt;/code&gt; to install Jenkins X.
Previously this happened when a user ran &lt;code&gt;jx boot&lt;/code&gt;. But from community feedback we learned that some users would like this process split.
To help with this we are in the process of developing Terraform modules that you can use to create the necessary resources.
Work on this has been moving really quickly and we have been focusing on support for GKE, EKS &amp;amp; AKS.
We are really excited to see the awesome contributions from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/helayoty&#34;&gt;Heba Elayoty&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoft.com&#34;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; on adding support for &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/&#34;&gt;Azure Kubernetes Service&lt;/a&gt; in Jenkins X.
If you do not use Terraform and you have another way of provisioning infrastructure don&amp;rsquo;t worry, we&amp;rsquo;ll be providing lots of information in the docs on exactly what you will need to create before booting Jenkins X.
For anyone that would like more information or would like to contribute to the Terraform modules you will find the git repository for GKE &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/terraform-google-jx&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and EKS &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/terraform-aws-eks-jx&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another area that some of the team are working in right now is the implementation of the depreciation policy, PRs are being lined up to remove commands that have been market for &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/commands/deprecation/&#34;&gt;deprecation&lt;/a&gt;. This will help cut down the code surface area a bit and make Jenkins X a bit easier to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x-labs&#34;&gt;labs team&lt;/a&gt; has also been extremely busy experimenting with &lt;a href=&#34;https://helm.sh/blog/helm-3-released/&#34;&gt;helm3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/roboll/helmfile&#34;&gt;helmfile&lt;/a&gt; with a view to using it as a foundation for multi cluster support in Jenkins X.
We still have a bit to learn before we start to roll this into Jenkins X. One of the next areas we&amp;rsquo;ll be experimenting with is what the upgrade process from a helm2 environment to a helm3 environment will look like.
You can jump over to the new &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/docs/labs/&#34;&gt;lab&amp;rsquo;s documentation&lt;/a&gt; for more information on experiments and you can find the lab&amp;rsquo;s issue tracker &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x-labs/issues/issues&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have also fixed around &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+updated%3A2020-03-01..2020-03-25+-label%3Alifecycle%2Frotten+&#34;&gt;60 issues&lt;/a&gt; this month.
We are constantly tracking our progress on closing out issues. The graph below shows the number of opened and closed issues on a weekly basis since September and the delta between them.
The trend over time clearly shows we are making good progress.

        &lt;p&gt;Jenkins X is incredibly happy to participate in &lt;a href=&#34;https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/&#34;&gt;Google Summer of Code 2020&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X has been open source from its inception and many of the founders and core contributors to Jenkins X have been deeply involved in open source for years. We love open source for many reasons, including how it enables rapid innovation and collaboration among remote, distributed teams and communities. For these reasons and more, we are very happy to participate in Google Summer of Code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Blog: Jenkins X  ❤ Tekton</title>
      <link>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/03/11/tekton/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 11 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/03/11/tekton/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Jenkins X is committing fully to Tekton as its pipeline execution engine. We are convinced that this is the right choice for Jenkins X, as a cloud-native CI/CD platform on Kubernetes, and for our users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means we are formally deprecating - and will be removing - traditional Jenkins static masters support inside Jenkins X. We are excited about the new way forward, which we’ll discuss further below, but it’s important to be clear about what this means for current users. If you are already using Jenkins X with Tekton-based pipelines, then nothing will change for you, and you do not need to change anything. If you’re running a traditional Jenkinsfile on Jenkins X, then you have three choices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue using static masters with a version of Jenkins X that supports Jenkins static masters
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that for versions of Jenkins X that support Jenkins static masters we will not provide any security fixes either to the jx CLI or to the Jenkins image used after mid April.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return to a more optimized Jenkins installation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or, if you plan on updating your version of Jenkins X to keep up with the latest features, then you will need to adapt your setup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, we will discuss how we arrived at this decision, why there is currently a choice between two different pipeline execution engines, and why it is better for the project and for our users to standardize on one. We will go over in more detail what these changes mean for current users, and the options we have to help current users on Jenkins static masters with these changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-story-of-pipeline-engines&#34;&gt;A story of Pipeline Engines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jenkins X was founded two years ago, Jenkins was chosen as its pipeline execution engine. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Familiarity: Jenkins is the most widely used orchestration system in history, and at CloudBees we know it quite well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was not a Kubernetes native pipeline engine, ie, there was no Tekton&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year later, Tekton had been founded and Jenkins X rapidly adopted the new Kubernetes-native pipeline engine. It became one of two options for users to choose as their pipeline execution engine within Jenkins X. This was huge for us, because Jenkins was never built to be used in the way we were using it, and the way Jenkins is architected made it very difficult to build Jenkins X forward with our dream features and keep things compatible and running well - Tekton solved all these problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, though, the users of Jenkins X can now choose between two very different pipeline execution engines &amp;ndash; Jenkins static masters or our own Tekton-based pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, a developer using Jenkins X does not need to think about the pipeline engine executing their CI/CD pipelines.  In practice, though, the Jenkins X user experience varies significantly depending on which pipeline engine the user choses. This is because of technical complexity and use case difference that makes standardization hard to achieve and even harder to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more functionality is added to the project which fits seamlessly with Tekton, Jenkins as a pipeline engine for Jenkins X increasingly feels unoptimized and inappropriate for the project. As amazing as Jenkins is, it wasn’t built to be an ephemeral cloud-native pipeline engine inside of a larger workflow tool, and maintaining Jenkins as a pipeline engine for Jenkins X has proven difficult and complex. The Jenkins X user experience with Jenkins static masters is already lesser than the user experience with Tekton, and it will only degrade further over time. For this reason, we have been recommending Tekton as the default pipeline engine in Jenkins X for more than 6 months now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way we see it, traditional Jenkins running on Kubernetes makes sense for Jenkins-based apps that already exist and for teams that aren’t ready to change their tooling and their process. Jenkins is rock-solid and can run forever doing what it does today for the hundreds of thousands of teams that use it. But, that’s not what Jenkins X is for. Jenkins X is for brand new applications, being built from the ground up for the world of Kubernetes-based, cloud-native development - and we want to make things as great as possible for all the developers building those kinds of applications right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;kubernetes-native&#34;&gt;Kubernetes native&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although for users the pipeline execution engine should be an implementation detail, for the Jenkins X project Tekton is clearly a better, more natural, fit. Like Jenkins X, Tekton is Kubernetes native: it was designed from the ground up to leverage Kubernetes, not merely integrate with Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jenkins X core team has chosen to standardize on Tekton as a pipeline execution engine for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes native&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Declarative, not scripted
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This makes pipelines easier to author, read, and maintain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly opinionated syntax, making it easier to work in a best-practices way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YAML! Not Groovy or Groovy-based syntax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Jenkins X has its own syntax on top of Tekton, to improve the user experience. Tekton’s syntax is very explicit, which is excellent for the level at which Tekton is operating. Jenkins X, as a developer-centric CI/CD platform, is able to take the information already available regarding a user’s configuration and provide that context. Additionally, Jenkins X provides an opinionated, best-practices based workflow. For these reasons, the amount of information a user needs to provide is reduced and the user experience is guided and simplified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Jenkins X, as a CI/CD platform on Kubernetes, Tekton is the right choice for the pipeline execution engine. Focusing on one pipeline engine going forward will enable a leaner, cleaner codebase and a better end-user experience. Standardizing on Tekton as the pipeline execution engine for Jenkins X enables the core team to focus on improving the Jenkins X user experience without having to support compatibility with two different pipeline engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-next&#34;&gt;What’s next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re deprecating traditional Jenkins masters in all new versions of Jenkins X. They will be removed from the codebase of future Jenkins X versions from April 20th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is an aggressive timeline, it’s important to know that if you’re currently running Jenkins X with traditional Jenkins today, it’s not going to disappear. You won’t be able to upgrade to new versions - but we will cut one final release right before the deadline to give you a stable version to use for as long as you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, If you’re looking to migrate existing declarative Jenkins jobs to Jenkins X, we have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx-convert-jenkinsfile&#34;&gt;partial Jenkinsfile translator&lt;/a&gt; that can help point you in the right direction. While it won’t fully translate all Jenkinsfiles, it will help point you in the right direction to get the ball rolling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, if you’d like to keep your Jenkins jobs running but as individual steps inside a Jenkins X pipeline, &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/docs/labs/jenkins/&#34;&gt;we have a proposal for remote execution&lt;/a&gt; as a new path forward. Since Jenkins itself can be run on Kubernetes, switching to a remote execution step via Jenkins X - or entirely to Jenkins if it makes more sense for you - should be an easy switch to make. We think this is a much better path forward, as it keeps Jenkins entirely out of Jenkins X while still letting you adopt Jenkins X right away and migrate your traditional Jenkins jobs to Tekton-based jobs over time. We expect a working proof of concept for the community soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know this is a big announcement on a fast timeline and a lot of ideas to take in. We’d love to talk to you about it! Please join the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/community/office_hours/&#34;&gt;office hours we have arranged on March 19th&lt;/a&gt; that will be fully dedicated to discussing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may reach out to me, &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:ejones@cloudbees.com&#34;&gt;Ethan Jones&lt;/a&gt;, if you’d like to discuss things one on one with some of our product and engineering team members.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blog: Walkthrough: Setting up Jenkins X on a Kubernetes cluster</title>
      <link>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/03/10/walkthrough/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/03/10/walkthrough/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through setting up Jenkins X on a Kubernetes cluster hosted on GKE. We will use GitHub as our Git provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this tutorial is to give a detailed step-by-step walkthrough of setting up Jenkins X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;setup-used-in-this-tutorial&#34;&gt;Setup used in this tutorial&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub as our Git provider and a GitHub user account, eg &lt;code&gt;MarckK&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account with the ability to provision kubernetes resources / create kubernetes clusters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X &lt;code&gt;jx&lt;/code&gt; binary installed. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/docs/getting-started/setup/install/&#34;&gt;here for instructions on installing the &lt;code&gt;jx&lt;/code&gt; binary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kubernetes command-line tool, which can be installed to your local installation using the &lt;code&gt;jx install&lt;/code&gt; command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;jx install dependencies -d kubectl
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are going to create a GitHub organisation which will have two members, a GitHub user account, eg &lt;code&gt;MarckK&lt;/code&gt;, and a GitHub &amp;lsquo;Pipeline&amp;rsquo; bot account, eg &lt;code&gt;jx-bot&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can create a new GitHub organisation by clicking the &lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt; at the top right of GitHub&amp;rsquo;s top navigation bar or by clicking to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/organizations/plan&#34;&gt;create an organization page&lt;/a&gt;. I chose the free &amp;lsquo;Team for Open Source&amp;rsquo; plan for my new GitHub organisation; this means the organisation will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have unlimited private repositories. Name your organisation anything you like, eg &lt;code&gt;jenkins-x-space&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invite your GitHub user account, eg &lt;code&gt;MarckK&lt;/code&gt;, to the organisation. This GitHub user account will create and manage development repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we create a GitHub Pipeline bot account. This Pipeline bot will automate pull request notifications and create preview environments for quick validation and acceptance for code merging. Your Pipeline bot should be created as a member of your GitHub organisation, eg &lt;code&gt;jenkins-x-space&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create an entirely new account that will be only for your bot. Name your bot anything you like, eg &lt;code&gt;jx-bot&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bot account must have a token created in your organization that authenticates the bot and allows it to perform various tasks on the repositories within your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generate a Git token for your Pipeline Bot with the correct permissions via this &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo,read:user,read:org,user:email,write:repo_hook,delete_repo&#34;&gt;GitHub Link&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;copy the 40 character token&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-warning&#34; role=&#34;alert&#34;&gt;

The 40 character token generated by GitHub is only shown once so you must copy this immediately before you close the browser tab or window, as the token cannot be retrieved once it is displayed. You will be asked for this token later, so please do keep a copy of it.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At this point, I signed out of my GitHub Pipeline bot account and back into my GitHub user account, eg &lt;code&gt;MarckK&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-1----create-a-kubernetes-cluster&#34;&gt;Step 1 -  Create a Kubernetes cluster&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;jx create cluster gke&lt;/code&gt; will create a cluster on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), which you can initialise with a name. From the command-line run:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;jx create cluster gke --skip-installation -n &amp;lt;cluster name&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program opens a web browser and you will be asked to choose the email address associated with your GCP account and to allow the Google Cloud SDK access to your account. After confirming, you can close the browswer page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at the command-line, the &lt;code&gt;jx create cluster&lt;/code&gt; program prompts you to choose your Google Cloud Project from the available list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program prompts you to choose the Zone nearest to where you would like to install your cluster. For example, if you want your cluster to serve users primarily in the east coast of the United states, you choose &lt;code&gt;us-east1-b&lt;/code&gt; from the available list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program runs automatically through default questions and begins creating the cluster in your specified zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the end, you will see output similar to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;NAME         LOCATION         MASTER_VERSION  MASTER_IP      MACHINE_TYPE   NODE_VERSION    NUM_NODES  STATUS
walkthrough  europe-north1-a  1.14.10-gke.17  35.228.74.166  n1-standard-2  1.14.10-gke.17  3          RUNNING
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congratulations you now have a Kubernetes cluster!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-2---installing-jenkins-x-on-a-cluster&#34;&gt;Step 2 - Installing Jenkins X on a cluster&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;!-- ### Edit all this with new jx boot —--git-public` flag (woohoo!)

```bash
jx boot --git-public
```

Does NOT work. Just returns: `Error: unknown flag: --git-public`
This has been implemented for `jx create` or `jx install` [apparently](https://jenkins-x.io/docs/getting-started/setup/boot/#git). Not jx boot. And unfortunately, that happens to be where I would like to have it enabled. --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First clone the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jenkins-x-boot-config&#34;&gt;Jenkins X Boot configuration repo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; into your newly cloned repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open the &lt;code&gt;jx-requirements.yml&lt;/code&gt; file of your newly cloned repo, eg. &lt;code&gt;jenkinx-x-boot-config/jx-requirements.yml&lt;/code&gt;. This specifies the requirements of your installation, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what Kubernetes provider to use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether to store secrets in the local file system or vault&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you are using Terraform to manage your cloud resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note, this is the main configuration file for &lt;code&gt;jx boot&lt;/code&gt; and where you make most of your configuration changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;jx-requirements.yml&lt;/code&gt; file is interesting to review, see the defaults in place, and make any changes you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my setup, I knew there was one change I needed to make to the &lt;code&gt;jx-requirements.yml&lt;/code&gt;. By default, Jenkins X will create private environment repos. You can see this configured in &lt;code&gt;jx-requirements.yml&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;environmentGitPublic: false&lt;/code&gt;. However, I set up a free open source GitHub organization to hold the environment repositories that will be created by Jenkins X, and this type of GitHub organization account does not have access to private repos. To configure Jenkins X to create public environment repositories, set &lt;code&gt;environmentGitPublic&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;jx-requirements.yml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save your changes and then on the command line run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;jx boot
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are not in a clone of a boot git repository then &lt;code&gt;jx boot&lt;/code&gt; will clone this repository and &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; into the clone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read more about &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/docs/getting-started/setup/boot/&#34;&gt;Jenkins X Boot in the documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Git and the pre-installation set up for Jenkins X will be checked and validated. You will see printed out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`Currently connected cluster is &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;cluster_name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;cluster_location&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in project ```&amp;lt;your_chosen_project&amp;gt;``&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be asked to confirm that you would like to &lt;code&gt;jx boot&lt;/code&gt; your &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;cluster_name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you will be asked a series of questions to ensure Jenkins X is installed properly on your cluster:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be asked to input the &lt;code&gt;Git Owner name for environment repositories&lt;/code&gt;: Type in the organistion you created, eg &lt;code&gt;jenkins-x-space&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be asked to provide &lt;code&gt;Comma-separated git provider usernames of approvers for development environment repository&lt;/code&gt;: Type in the name of the GitHub account that is a member of the organisation you created, eg &lt;code&gt;MarckK&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may receive a Warning that &lt;code&gt;TLS is not enabled so your webhooks will be called using HTTP.&lt;/code&gt; You will be asked for confirmation to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you type &amp;lsquo;No&amp;rsquo;, the &lt;code&gt;jx boot&lt;/code&gt; process will end with &lt;code&gt;error: cannot continue because TLS is not enabled.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you type &amp;lsquo;Yes&amp;rsquo;, then namespace &lt;code&gt;jx&lt;/code&gt; will be created in your cluster and Jenkins X booted in that namespace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be asked if you wish to upgrade &lt;code&gt;jx&lt;/code&gt;. It is recommended you say &amp;lsquo;Yes&amp;rsquo; and then re-run &lt;code&gt;jx boot&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be information logged on enabling storage on GKE. You do not need to enable storage for this walkthrough tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will see information on the pipeline steps of JX Boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be asked &lt;code&gt;Jenkins X Admin Username&lt;/code&gt;: Type in a username or press return to have the default username of &lt;code&gt;admin&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will then be asked for &lt;code&gt;Jenkins X Admin Password&lt;/code&gt;: Type one in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will then be asked for &lt;code&gt;Pipeline bot Git username&lt;/code&gt;: Type in the name of the Pipeline Bot you created, eg &lt;code&gt;jx-bot&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will then be asked for &lt;code&gt;Pipeline bot Git email address&lt;/code&gt;: Type in the email address you used when setting up your Pipeline Bot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will then be asked for &lt;code&gt;Pipeline bot Git token&lt;/code&gt;: Type in the token generated and saved previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be asked, &lt;code&gt;Do you want to configure an external Docker Registry?&lt;/code&gt;: &amp;lsquo;No&amp;rsquo; is sufficient for this tutorial&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More pipeline steps will be run. You should see output that your pods are running and other verification information telling you the state of your Jenkins x set-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you will see confirmation on the state of your installation process, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Installation is currently looking: GOOD&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the organisation you created, eg &lt;code&gt;jenkins-x-space&lt;/code&gt;, there should now be 3 additional repositories for the dev, staging, and production environments, which map to the dev, staging, and production namespaces in your cluster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X should be installed on your Kubernetes cluster. 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see the Jenkins X environments that have been created, the corresponding GitOps git repos, and the default promotion strategy between environments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;jx get environments
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should see something similar to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt; NAME       LABEL       KIND        PROMOTE NAMESPACE     ORDER CLUSTER SOURCE                                                                    REF    PR
dev        Development Development Never   jx            &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;             https://github.com/jenkins-x-space/environment-walkthrough-dev.git        master
staging    Staging     Permanent   Auto    jx-staging    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;           https://github.com/jenkins-x-space/environment-walkthrough-staging.git    master
production Production  Permanent   Manual  jx-production &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;           https://github.com/jenkins-x-space/environment-walkthrough-production.git master
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note the following details in the PROMOTE column:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development has &lt;strong&gt;Never&lt;/strong&gt; promote, because you&amp;rsquo;re working locally in this environment and not deploying anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Staging environment&amp;rsquo;s default is to &lt;strong&gt;Auto&lt;/strong&gt; promote, meaning any merge performed on the repo&amp;rsquo;s master branch will automatically be deployed as a new version to staging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Production environment&amp;rsquo;s default is to have a &lt;strong&gt;Manual&lt;/strong&gt; promotion strategy, meaning that you will have to manually promote your staging application version into production by using a jx promotion command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SOURCE column shows each environment&amp;rsquo;s configuration git repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-3---create-an-application&#34;&gt;Step 3 - Create an application&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have a working cluster with Jenkins X installed, you are going to create an
application that can be built &amp;amp; deployed with Jenkins X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;using-a-quickstart&#34;&gt;Using a quickstart&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JX has a &lt;code&gt;create quickstart&lt;/code&gt; command that will create a build from a standardised template.
To run this command, change your directory so that you are no longer within the &lt;code&gt;jenkins-x-boot-config&lt;/code&gt; directory, then type the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;jx create quickstart --git-public&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are adding the &lt;code&gt;--git-public=true&lt;/code&gt; flag to ensure that our new quickstart application will create repositories that are public on GitHub, as our freemium GitHub organisation requires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this example, select &lt;code&gt;golang-http&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be asked a series of questions such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Do you wish to use &amp;lt;your GitHub user name&amp;gt; as the Git user name?&lt;/code&gt;: Choose &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Who should be the owner of the repository?&lt;/code&gt;: Choose the organisation you have created, eg &lt;code&gt;jenkins-x-space&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Enter the new repository name&lt;/code&gt;: Choose a name for your new application, such
as &lt;code&gt;jx-tutorial&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JX will then guide you through setting up the git repository for the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is the first application you have created, it may take a few minutes to download all
of the required builder images in order to build/deploy the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To view the status of the application, you can use the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;jx get activity -f jx-tutorial -w
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: -f is for &amp;ndash;filter and -w is for &amp;ndash;watch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the pipeline is complete, to view the application in each environment along with urls:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;jx get applications
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;promote-the-application-to-production&#34;&gt;Promote the application to production&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;jx promote&lt;/code&gt; command, you can push this version from staging to
production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;cd jx-tutorial
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you have 2FA enabled on your GitHub account, then you may need to use an api token as your password when prompted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;jx promote jx-tutorial --version 0.0.1 --env production
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can check the progress of the production deployment using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;jx get activity -f jx-tutorial -w
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;jx get applications
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;congratulations&#34;&gt;Congratulations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re all set!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You now have a fully configured Jenkins X installation on Google Kubernetes Engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid running up unnecessary costs, you may wish to shut down your kubernetes cluster at this point.  To view all clusters running with the current account use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;gcloud container clusters list
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To delete the cluster run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;gcloud container clusters delete &amp;lt;clustername&amp;gt; --zone &amp;lt;zone&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Blog: Google Secrets Manager Kubernetes controller</title>
      <link>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/03/05/gsm-controller/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 05 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/03/05/gsm-controller/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/images/logo/secret-manager.png&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jenkins X Labs we have been working with &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs&#34;&gt;Google Secrets Manager&lt;/a&gt; (which is currently in Beta so may still change). It is an extremely nice experience and if you also use Google Container Engine (GKE), Google’s managed Kubernetes service then we can make use of another cool feature, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity&#34;&gt;Workload Identity&lt;/a&gt; to automatically access secrets in their hosted service using a Kubernetes service account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the initial challenges we had was we didn’t see an obvious way to automatically create Kubernetes secrets that include the data stored from Secrets Manager. So we created a little standalone controller that runs in a Kubernetes cluster and watches for Kubernetes secrets. When one is added or updated with a particular annotation the controller will access the secret using its ID in Secrets Manager and update the Kubernetes secret with the value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;example&#34;&gt;Example&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full docs and code can be found here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x-labs/gsm-controller/blob/master/README.md&#34;&gt;https://github.com/jenkins-x-labs/gsm-controller/blob/master/README.md&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tldr&#34;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create an empty secret&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;kubectl create secret generic my-secret
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add the magic annotation that the controller uses to lookup the correct secret in Googles Secret Manager&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;kubectl annotate secret my-secret jenkins-x.io/gsm-secret-id=foo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optionally if you want the Kubernetes secret to use a specific key for the data you can add another annotation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;kubectl annotate secret my-secret jenkins-x.io/gsm-kubernetes-secret-key=credentials.json
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;demo&#34;&gt;Demo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;360&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/wLHgkhzeNe8&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;autoplay; encrypted-media&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;feadback&#34;&gt;Feadback&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is still early days and we’d love folks to try it and provide feedback (&lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/community/#slack&#34;&gt;slack&lt;/a&gt; or the new &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x-labs/issues/issues&#34;&gt;labs issues&lt;/a&gt;) on whether it is useful to others and how we can improve it together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Jenkins X we make use of Hashicorp’s Vault which is great although it is another service users have to run, manage and upgrade. Wherever possible Jenkins X aims to use the Cloud well, so when users are installing Jenkins X onto a Cloud Provider we would like to leverage their other managed services, reducing the deployments we need to run in users clusters for Jenkins X.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blog: Jenkins X Labs</title>
      <link>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/02/28/jxl-feb-20/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/02/28/jxl-feb-20/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/images/logo/labs.png&#34; width=&#34;40%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X has entered it&amp;rsquo;s third year and as always we are looking for big ways things can be improved.  Briefly reflecting on the last two years:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;first was about initial adoption and finding out what developers were both looking for and needed when moving to Kubernetes.  We started off using a Static Jenkins server for example to orchestrate builds and other open source projects that folks would be familiar with, to aid their journey to the cloud.  We quickly realised that the Jenkins X community wanted to leverage more of their cloud capabilities and so we began to swap in cloud native implementations like Tekton and Prow, as well as better integration with managed cloud services like storage, dns, IAM etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;second year was about improving that developer experience and making the architectural approaches we settled on a reliable experience.  This has been a lot of work and there&amp;rsquo;s still a lot more to do, infact we know this will always be an ongoing effort.  Some of the recent highlights of this effort can start to be seen with more details on this &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/02/26/cjxd-feb-20/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now that we have started our third year we look at how we can effectively innovate in Jenkins X, grow collaborations with other open source projects and communities and of course build up the Jenkins X community itself.  All the time we need to do this with the second years efforts in mind and not lose sight that we need to evolve as a mature project that people and teams can rely on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve started by introducing the idea of an enhancement process.  The aim here is to raise ideas and larger problems that folks would like to collaborate on earlier than when a Pull Request is created.  Sometimes issues are a bit low level and for bigger efforts we&amp;rsquo;d like to raise the profile, potentially discuss in office hours, getting as much early feedback as possible and hope to attract folks looking to be involved.  This is aimed to be a lightweight process and be used to help get things right earlier.  It is not meant to stifle progress, rather enhance it.  Not all changes to Jenkins X should have an enhancement proposal, we still want to attract contributions but for larger efforts this will hopefully help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enhancement proposals are currently raised as a pull request to this repository &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/enhancements&#34;&gt;https://github.com/jenkins-x/enhancements&lt;/a&gt;.  Jenkins X creates a lot of GitHub notifications with all the releases and bot updates but this repo would be useful to &amp;lsquo;watch&amp;rsquo; and see new proposals + discussions as they happen.  Please if you have any views we&amp;rsquo;d absolutely love to hear them and every comment will be treated respectfully and in a safe healthy environment.  We&amp;rsquo;ve already had &lt;strong&gt;GREAT&lt;/strong&gt; input from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/polothy&#34;&gt;polothy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/salaboy&#34;&gt;salaboy&lt;/a&gt; and a bunch of core maintainers as well as PMs and engineering managers.  We&amp;rsquo;d like to encourage involvement from any background that would like to help Jenkins X and be part of something that we can all be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of this blog wants to take your attention to an enhancement proposal which is currently up for review &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/enhancements/pull/15&#34;&gt;https://github.com/jenkins-x/enhancements/pull/15&lt;/a&gt;.  This aims to tackle the challenge outlined above, of how do we enable rapid innovation, increase contributions and collaborations while keeping Jenkins X stable.  Please take a look and feed any comments on, it is high level for a reason as we are still learning the right balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR of the above proposal suggests we build out an incubation hub of sorts where we can create new features which we don&amp;rsquo;t know how they might be received, gather feedback and other metrics to decide whether the feature is good to mature into the main Jenkins X org.  The idea is to use an approach where features are ready for &lt;code&gt;alpha&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;beta&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;GA&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already started piloting this effort in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x-labs&#34;&gt;Jenkins X Labs&lt;/a&gt; GitHub org where a small team has been proving out a feature to handle Jenkins X deploying to different clusters including different cloud providers.  The feature is known as multi cluster but we will be documenting, demoing and asking people to help be involved either in development or trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be putting together a roadmap, starting off small but would love suggestions &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x-labs/issues&#34;&gt;https://github.com/jenkins-x-labs/issues&lt;/a&gt;
It is important to stress that work which happens in the Jenkins X Labs GitHub organisation may or may not mature into the Jenkins X org.  We will work hard to prove out any ideas and and gather as much feedback as we can and improve.  We would be looking to make it clear users opt into using &lt;code&gt;alpha&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;beta&lt;/code&gt; features so we maintain a solid base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are super excited by this proposal, the rate of innovation it will unlock and the level of OSS collaboration possible all the time having another focus on stability and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2020 is fully underway and Jenkins X is feeling the benefits from a lot of hard work from the tail end of last year.  There is now support on EKS for Jenkins X!  Here are the docs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/docs/getting-started/setup/boot/clouds/amazon/&#34;&gt;https://jenkins-x.io/docs/getting-started/setup/boot/clouds/amazon/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are still being improved so we&amp;rsquo;d love feedback in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/community/#slack&#34;&gt;Slack channel&lt;/a&gt; or issues (PRs would be even better ;)) on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx-docs&#34;&gt;website repository&lt;/a&gt; to help improve.  By the way a Pull Request on the docs repo results in a preview environment of the website, so you can see your changes and ask for feedback in true Jenkins X form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EKS support includes full TLS and DNS, Vault and documented required IAM roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is largely a result of contributions from CloudBees as they work on building out CloudBees Jenkins X Distribution (CJXD).  This distro can come with support from CloudBees but is based on the upstream Jenkins X, there&amp;rsquo;s no separate fork so any code that is needed to support EKS and other Jenkins X features goes into the Jenkins X codebase, for the Jenkins X community to benefit from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as EKS support last month there were 30 issues and enhancements resolved so there&amp;rsquo;s lots of effort to keep continually improving Jenkins X.  At the bottom of this blog is list of the main issues fixed.  An important fix to call out is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/6568&#34;&gt;6568&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large ongoing work looks to replace Prow (which handles ChatOps and the communication with GitHub) with Lighthouse, which has wider git server support (including future support for Bitbucket and Gitlab) and a smaller footprint. We hope to have this switch completed in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a monthly blog that will describe the improvements that keep making Jenkins X better so please keep an eye out for these and as always let us know via slack or issues how things can be better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;list-of-issues-fixed-in-february&#34;&gt;List of issues fixed in February&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/5597&#34;&gt;App installation requires Jenkins X with Vault installed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/6589&#34;&gt;BitBucket Server with boot/gitops/vault gets error for \No git service found&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/6515&#34;&gt;bug: jx ui not working with latest cli and boot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/6668&#34;&gt;bug: overriding &lt;code&gt;env&lt;/code&gt; variables in buildpacks doesn&amp;rsquo;t work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/6679&#34;&gt;Change in googleapis/gnostic breaks \make generate-openapi&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/6568&#34;&gt;controllerbuild can&amp;rsquo;t list config maps and so can&amp;rsquo;t get git credentials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/6577&#34;&gt;CreateTestJxHomeDir only creates tmp JX_HOME in case gitAuth.yaml exists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/6617&#34;&gt;Dev pipeline fails on fresh jx boot install using bitbucketserver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/5669&#34;&gt;Diagnose and fix sporadic hangs on environment promotes in boot-vault and boot-local versions BDD tests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/6503&#34;&gt;Document and share development steps required to support Jenkins X on Kubernetes providers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/4388&#34;&gt;Document full list of IAM permissions needed when using EKS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/6545&#34;&gt;Duplicated SourceRepository resources&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/6415&#34;&gt;Enhancement: Show ConfigMaps on jx diagnose output&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/6579&#34;&gt;Git Authentication fails on GHE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/6551&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;jx boot&lt;/code&gt; failing on GHE with latest CLI due to failing GET request&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/6523&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;jx boot&lt;/code&gt; STEP: verify-jenkins-x-environment failing. Returning &lt;code&gt;401&lt;/code&gt; Unauthorized, Body&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/6543&#34;&gt;jx boot upgrade replaces OWNERS with OWNERS from jenkins-x-boot-config&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/6618&#34;&gt;jx create pullrequest with Gitlab somehow ends up with a -/&amp;quot; in URL&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/6482&#34;&gt;jx get build log -&amp;gt; error: secrets \jenkins&amp;quot; not found&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/6419&#34;&gt;jx preview fails for repo in bitbucket server&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/6596&#34;&gt;Knowing how many resources exist for CRD&amp;rsquo;s is useful when maintaining cluster, a command to list these counts would be helpful&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/6637&#34;&gt;Maven builders in meta pipeline should mount settings.xml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/6685&#34;&gt;Not able to boot Jenkins X with local changes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/6722&#34;&gt;Pass the repo owner into &lt;code&gt;jx step git credentials --credential-helper&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/6610&#34;&gt;PipelineResource names can be reused, causing collisions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/6646&#34;&gt;PipelineRuns rerun by Lighthouse due to Tekton race condition won&amp;rsquo;t be handled by build controller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/5020&#34;&gt;rename &lt;code&gt;jx step  create install values&lt;/code&gt; to something more accurate &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/6698&#34;&gt;REPLACE_ME placeholders in buildpacks using modern syntax aren&amp;rsquo;t replaced&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/6439&#34;&gt;Review command deprecation proposal and generate issues accordingly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/5772&#34;&gt;Unable to re-run &amp;lsquo;jx boot&amp;rsquo; from the initial boot config directory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://fosdem.org/2020/&#34;&gt;FOSDEM 2020&lt;/a&gt; was fantastic! We were thrilled to be there, answering questions about Jenkins X at the Jenkins X - CDF - Jenkins booth.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blog: Asking and Finding help - Outreachy</title>
      <link>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/01/22/outreachy2019/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/01/22/outreachy2019/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/images/community/events/outreachy.png&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neha Gupta is adding support for Kustomize in Jenkins X, to enable Kubernetes native configuration management, while participating in Outreachy from December 2019 to March 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;outreachy-open-source-contribution-for-applicants--askingfinding-help&#34;&gt;Outreachy open-source contribution for applicants — Asking/Finding help&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog might be helpful for beginners who are fear-stricken or I would say hesitant to ASK, to get lost in the new world while trying to understand any open source project, fear of asking questions that may sound stupid later on or are very obvious!
First of all..
Relax!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone starts from somewhere and has a learning curve!..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some pre-requisites that may help you get into open-source development better..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn basics of git operations. (&lt;a href=&#34;https://learngitbranching.js.org&#34;&gt;https://learngitbranching.js.org&lt;/a&gt; , I find this easy and helpful).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to find an open-source project (remember : you’re going to contribute to a part of it, so it’s okay if some/many things doesn’t make sense in the beginning, because it’s easier to write code than to understand someone else’s code).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For selecting a project you may also look for Google-Summer-of-Code, Outreachy, Google-Code-In, RSoC and other open-source programs and their organisations that helps people/students/aspiring developers to find your best interest communities and projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE : Beware! seeing too many organisations and projects will only confuse you, so start with only one or max 2 projects, try to deep-dive and focus on them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After selecting the project :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connect with the community through their communication channels for both developers and users (example : Slack, IRC-Cloud, Zulip, Riot etc )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to read the documentation and understand the overall structure and purpose of the project you’re starting to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t understand something functionality wise — just ask! Ask on the communication channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are facing any error — Google search it, or try to look into the existing issues, if you’re not able to move forward and you’re stuck on the same error for more than 45 mins, just ask! Trust me! There’s no harm. In-fact, people of open-source communities appreciate it, feels motivated when there are users asking them about something that they’re passionately building. It also sometimes, helps the community to re-define and re-align the product and some features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy learning! :)&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The Jenkins X project started the beginning of 2019 by celebrating its first birthday on the 14th January, a big event for any open source project, and we have just celebrated our 2nd - hooray!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;two-years-of-jenkins-x&#34;&gt;Two Years of Jenkins X!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X has evolved from a vision of how CI/CD could be reimagined in a cloud native world, to a fast-moving, innovative, rapidly maturing open source project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X was created to help developers ship code fast on Kubernetes. From the start, Jenkins X has focused on improving the developer experience. Using one command line tool, developers can create a Kubernetes cluster, deploy a pipeline, create an app, create a GitHub repository, push the app to the GitHub repository, open a Pull Request, build a container, run that container in Kubernetes, merge to production. To do this, Jenkins X automates the installation and configuration of a whole bunch of best in breed open source tools, and automates the generation of all the pipelines. Jenkins X also automates the promotion of an application through testing, staging, and production environments, enabling lots of feedback on proposed changes. For example, Jenkins X preview environments allow for fast and early feedback as developers can review actual functionality in an automatically provisioned environment. We’ve found that preview environments, created automatically inside the pipelines created by Jenkins X, are very popular with developers, as they can view changes before they are merged to master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X is opinionated, yet easily extensible. Built to enable DevOps best practices, Jenkins X is designed to the deployment of large numbers of distributed microservices in a repeatable and manageable fashion, across multiple teams. Jenkins X facilitates proven best practices like trunk based development and GitOps. To get you up and running quickly, Jenkins X comes with lots of example quickstarts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;highlights-of-2019&#34;&gt;Highlights of 2019&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;february-2019-the-rise-of-tekton&#34;&gt;February 2019: The rise of Tekton!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second half of 2018, Jenkins X embarked on a journey to provide a Serverless Jenkins and run a pipeline engine only when required. That pipeline engine was based on the knative build-pipeline project which evolved into Tekton with much help and love from both the Jenkins and Jenkins X communities. &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2019/02/19/jenkins-x-next-gen-pipeline-engine/&#34;&gt;The Jenkins X project completed its initial integration with Tekton in February 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Tekton is a powerful and flexible kubernetes-native open source framework for creating CI/CD pipelines, managing artifacts and progressive deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/images/second-birthday/plane.png&#34; width=&#34;40%&#34; float=&#34;left&#34;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;march-2019-jenkins-x-joined-the-continuous-delivery-foundation&#34;&gt;March 2019: Jenkins X joined The Continuous Delivery Foundation!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/images/logo/cdf-logo.png&#34; width=&#34;40%&#34; float=&#34;left&#34;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X joined the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF) as a founding project alongside Jenkins, Spinnaker, and Tekton. Joining a vendor-neutral foundation, focused on Continuous Delivery, made a lot of sense to the Jenkins X community. There had already been a high level of collaboration with the Jenkins and Tekton communities, and there have been some very interesting and fruitful (in terms of ideas) discussions about how to work better with the Spinnaker communities also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;june-2019-project-lighthouse&#34;&gt;June 2019: Project Lighthouse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jenkins X embarked on its serverless jenkins journey, it chose to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow&#34;&gt;Prow&lt;/a&gt;, an event handler for GitHub events and ChatOps. Prow is used by the Kubernetes project for building all of its repos and includes a powerful webhook event handler. Prow is well proven, but heavily tied to GitHub, and not easily extendable to other SCM providers.  At the end of June 2019, work commenced on a lightweight, extensible alternative to Prow, called &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/docs/reference/components/lighthouse/&#34;&gt;Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;. Lighthouse supports the same plugins as Prow (so you can still ask via ChatOps for cats and dogs) and the same config - making migration between Prow and Lighthouse extremely easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;june-2019-jenkins-x-boot&#34;&gt;June 2019: Jenkins X Boot!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were very busy in June - a frantic burst of activity before summer vacations!  One common problem Jenkins X users were facing was the installation of Jenkins X on different Kubernetes clusters.  Installing services, ensuring DNS and secrets are correct, and done in the right order is completely different from vendor to vendor, and sometimes cluster to cluster. We realised that to simplify the install, we really needed a pipeline, and whilst this may sound a little like the plot to a film, running a  Jenkins X pipeline to install jx really is the best option. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/docs/getting-started/setup/boot/&#34;&gt;jx boot command&lt;/a&gt; interprets the boot pipeline using your local jx binary. The jx boot command can also be used for updating your cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt; --&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;july-2019-a-new-logo&#34;&gt;July 2019: A New Logo!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the move to the CDF the Jenkins X project took the opportunity to redesign its  logo. An automaton represents the ability of Jenkins X to provide automated CI/CD on Kubernetes and more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/images/second-birthday/jx-logo-stacked-color.png&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34; float=&#34;left&#34;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;second-half-2019-big-focus-on-stability-and-reliability&#34;&gt;Second half 2019: Big focus on Stability and Reliability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jenkins X project has been fast paced with lots of different components and moving parts. This fast pace unfortunately led to some instability and a growth of serious issues that risked undermining all the great work there had been on Jenkins X. There has been a concerted effort by the community to increase stability and reduce outstanding issues - the graph below shows the trend over the last year, with a notable downward trend in the number of issues being created in the last 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/images/second-birthday/graph.png&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34; float=&#34;left&#34;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CloudBees also aided this effort by introducing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cloudbees.com/products/cloudbees-jenkins-x-distribution/overview&#34;&gt;CloudBees Jenkins X Distribution&lt;/a&gt; with increased testing around stabilized configurations and deployments and regular releases every month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;october-2019-jenkins-x-steering-committee-inaugural-meeting&#34;&gt;October 2019: Jenkins X Steering Committee inaugural meeting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jenkins X Bootstrap &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/steering&#34;&gt;Steering Committee&lt;/a&gt; is tasked with organising the transition to an elected steering committee, as well as determining what responsibilities the steering committee will have in guiding the Jenkins X project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;december-2019-first-jenkins-x-outreachy-mentee&#34;&gt;December 2019: First Jenkins X Outreachy mentee!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/images/community/events/outreachy.png&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34; float=&#34;left&#34;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neha Gupta is adding support for Kustomize in Jenkins X, to enable Kubernetes native configuration management, while participating in Outreachy from December 2019 to March 2020. We welcome Neha’s work on Jenkins X and look forward to building on our culture of continuous mentoring!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jenkins-x-usage-in-products&#34;&gt;Jenkins X usage in Products&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to try out Jenkins X is undoubtedly through &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cloudbees.com/products/cloudbees-ci-cd/overview&#34;&gt;CloudBees CI/CD powered by Jenkins X&lt;/a&gt; which provides Jenkins X through the convenience and ease of use of SaaS. No cluster setup, no Jenkins X install, that is all done for you! Currently, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cloudbees.com/products/cloudbees-ci-cd/overview&#34;&gt;CloudBees CI/CD powered by Jenkins X&lt;/a&gt; is available for preview. Sign up &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cloudbees.com/products/cloudbees-ci-cd/overview&#34;&gt;here to try out the new Jenkins X Saas&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/images/second-birthday/boxes.png&#34; width=&#34;40%&#34; float=&#34;left&#34;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-next&#34;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jenkins X project is going to be encouraging the community to get involved with more innovation. There are a lot of great ideas to extend the continuous story with integrated progressive delivery (A/B testing, Canary and Blue/Green deployments) and Continuous Verification, alongside more platforms support. We are expecting lots of awesome new features in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-jenkins-x-distribution/latest/user-interface/&#34;&gt;CloudBees UI for Jenkins X&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expect lots more exciting new announcements from Jenkins X in 2020!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blog: Outreachy - Motivation to apply! </title>

&lt;img src=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/images/community/events/outreachy.png&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neha Gupta is adding support for Kustomize in Jenkins X, to enable Kubernetes native configuration management, while participating in Outreachy from December 2019 to March 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;motivation-to-apply-to-outreachy-&#34;&gt;Motivation to apply to Outreachy :&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my graduation class of fifty people we were three girls struggling to set up our space and comfort with the weird reactions we got from fellow students for trying to understand technology.
When my professor asked us to make an autonomous drone. I couldn’t make one, I was shattered, until a friend from computer science batch helped me make one. He showed me some of the cool apps he made, that sparked an interest, and I started building apps, realising that computer science is beyond just coding, it’s more about solving real life problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve transitioned from mobile to web apps, server-end development, robotics, cloud architecting, and also cofounding a startup. I’ve been focusing on using AI to make smarter apps, and help students think beyond, and see the bigger picture. I’m hoping to start an accelerator, regulating the perception about technology, focusing especially on hidden potential behind fear-stricken girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I heard about Outreachy program and I liked how women and other minority communities are being supported and motivated. It felt something similar to what I’m trying to do with the young girls around me (breaking the stereotypical phenomenon of “girls can’t code”). I felt participating in Outreachy will not only boost my but other girls motivation too! and it’ll also definitely help me grow technologically, socially and mentally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-excited-about-outreachy&#34;&gt;Why excited about Outreachy?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me it feels really cool to work with a team remotely. The interactions, networking and feel is completely different, especially when it’s open-source (Like ..I get anxious before asking questions on public channels, if the question is too logical and stupid). Also, I’m a fan of open-source contributions, so… (here was the chance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason was to interact with the minority community (people who are facing similar issues in STEM like me) and share some instances with them, be on the same page, enlighten and get enlightened (all that networking sounds fun..). I am also excited about the trip.
Why Jenkins-X?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cloud Storage backed Helm repository idea seemed interesting, so I started exploring it. The project was also quite different from other listed (maybe because it was meant for me :D ), I only contributed to it and focused on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also the community was very welcoming and communications with my mentor were good. He helped me making contributions to the project, he guided me to some good first issues, helped me correct my PR’s. Jenkins-X looked as an interesting open-source project so I’m glad I tried to be a part of it and got selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-would-i-tell-someone-who-is-worried-about-applying-to-outreachy&#34;&gt;What would I tell someone who is worried about applying to Outreachy?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are someone who has just started open source contributions and are fear stricken on how is it gonna work? These all things seems so confusing and you’re overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t worry! ..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was too! Every one is.. and this is just step — 1. Anyone who’s going to pick up a new project which is production ready and thousands/millions of people are using it, is going to be confused! This is normal and natural (the initial learning curve), but once you overcome it. Things become so normal and understanding, people are here to help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think you can’t make it because of the competition, how does matter? If not this time, next time (I myself got selected after 3 years of trying), you anyway has to start one day, so let it be today. But the learnings you take away from the process, are insanely valuable and every-time it’s gonna become easier..
Feel free to reach me if you are facing any issues regarding starting with open-source contributions or if you have question saying — shall I apply to Outreachy this time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good Luck! :)&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://fosdem.org/2020/&#34;&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/a&gt; is a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas, and collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/images/community/events/2020-fosdem.png&#34; class=&#34;img-thumbnail&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fosdem&#34;&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://fosdem.org/2020/about/&#34;&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/a&gt; (Free and Open source Software Developers’ European Meeting) is a non-commercial, volunteer-organized European event centered on free and open source software development. It is aimed at developers and anyone interested in the free and open source software movement. FOSDEM will take place on 1 and 2 of February in Brussels, Belgium. See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://fosdem.org/2020/&#34;&gt;event site for more details&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of talks and events at FOSDEM are held in &amp;lsquo;developer rooms&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;devrooms&amp;rsquo;, which are organised and managed by open source projects to foster discussion and collaboration. In the Jenkins X community, we are excited to participate in the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) devroom at FOSDEM!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-the-cicd-devroom&#34;&gt;About the CI/CD Devroom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/track/continuous_integration_and_continuous_deployment/&#34;&gt;CI/CD devroom&lt;/a&gt; will take place on &lt;strong&gt;2nd of February 2020 in Brussels, Belgium&lt;/strong&gt;. The CI/CD devroom will focus on OSS projects that help &amp;ldquo;improve the quality of our software by automating tests, deliveries or deployments&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/track/continuous_integration_and_continuous_deployment/&#34;&gt;schedule for the CI/CD devroom&lt;/a&gt; is up and is packed with 12 interesting talks. Many of the talks specifically address issues around CI/CD on Kubernetes and a number of the talks are on Jenkins X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to the volunteer organisers of the CI/CD devroom, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/0lblak&#34;&gt;Olivier Vernin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://mobile.twitter.com/loswillios&#34;&gt;Jan Willies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mobile.twitter.com/thoulen&#34;&gt;Fabrizio Manfredi&lt;/a&gt;, who have picked awesome talks during what must have been a difficult selection process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fringe-and-jenkins-x-workshop&#34;&gt;Fringe and Jenkins X workshop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://fosdem.org/2020/fringe/&#34;&gt;The FOSDEM Fringe&lt;/a&gt; consists of independent events involving free and open source software taking place in the days around the FOSDEM weekend. They are organised independently of FOSDEM by open source communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;strong&gt;Thursday, January 30&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/vfarcic&#34;&gt;Viktor Farcic&lt;/a&gt; will be presenting a full day workshop on Jenkins X, as described in this abbreviated abstract:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-primary&#34; role=&#34;alert&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X is a combination of best of breed tools and software for Kubernetes. It provides an interactive command-line interface to instantiate applications, repositories, environments, and pipelines and orchestrate continuous integration and continuous delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the CI/CD solution for development of modern cloud applications on Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll explore how to create a fully operational continuous delivery pipeline using containers, Kubernetes, Jenkins X, and quite a few other tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop will take place from 8:30am to 5:00pm at the Marivaux Hotel Congress and Seminar Centre, Boulevard Adolphe Maxlaan 98, 1000 Brussels. There will be breakfast and snacks provided, for which there is a 25 Euro charge. Please sign up on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/workshop-cloud-native-kubernetes-first-serverless-continuous-delivery-with-jenkins-x-kubernetes-and-tickets-87082627483&#34;&gt;eventbrite event page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jenkins community will also be leading a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/jenkins-pipeline-fundamentals-training-tickets-87080214265&#34;&gt;workshop on Jenkin Pipelines&lt;/a&gt; run by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/MarkEWaite&#34;&gt;Mark Waite&lt;/a&gt;. The workshop will be from 8:00am to 12:00pm and breakfast will be provided for a 22 Euro charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;important-dates&#34;&gt;Important Dates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30 January, 2020: Jenkins and Jenkins X workshops, FOSDEM Fringe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 February, 2020: CI/CD Devroom, FOSDEM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to seeing you at FOSDEM!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who can&amp;rsquo;t make it, the talks in the CI/CD devroom will be recorded and made available under a Creative Commons license on the FOSDEM website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re having a Jenkins X hackathon in Lisbon on December 2! The hackathon is free to attend and will be a joint hackathon with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins.io/&#34;&gt;Jenkins project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/266201129&#34;&gt;Register here&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the hackathon. All levels of contributors are welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note this hackathon takes place the day before &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2019/10/18/jenkins-x-contributor-summit-lisbon/&#34;&gt;the Jenkins X Contributor Summit&lt;/a&gt;, which is also free to attend and we would love to see you at both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These events are being organised for the community in the days prior to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cloudbees.com/devops-world/lisbon&#34;&gt;DevOps World | Jenkins World Lisbon&lt;/a&gt;. We realised many Jenkins X and Jenkins community members will be attending the conference and  wanted to create additional opportunities for community members to meet and collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cloudbees.com/devops-world/lisbon&#34;&gt;DevOps World | Jenkins World&lt;/a&gt; conference pass is not necessary to attend the hackathon or &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2019/10/18/jenkins-x-contributor-summit-lisbon/&#34;&gt;the Jenkins X Contributor Summit&lt;/a&gt;. However, if you are planning on attending DevOps World | Jenkins World, the conference organizers are offering a 30% discount on registration with code &lt;strong&gt;JWFOSS&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hackathon Agenda:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9:00 am - Welcome with coffee/pastries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9:30 am - Introductions &amp;amp; topic discussions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10:30 am - Hacking starts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12:00 pm - Lunch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1:00 pm - More hacking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5:00 pm - Wrap-up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/266201129&#34;&gt;register&lt;/a&gt; if you can attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attendance at the Jenkins X Contributor Summit is free, and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cloudbees.com/devops-world/lisbon&#34;&gt;DevOps World | Jenkins World&lt;/a&gt; conference pass is not necessary, but please &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/jenkins-x-contributor-summit-2019-lisbon-portugal-tickets-77484886381&#34;&gt;RSVP&lt;/a&gt; if you are going to attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jenkins X Contributor Summit is an opportunity for current and future Jenkins X contributors to come together to discuss the project, learn and collaborate. There will be discussions on the latest exciting developments in Jenkins X and time to contribute to the project. We welcome new contributors: this is a great chance to learn more about the project, find out how to contribute and meet the core contributors!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contributor summit is part of a joint contributor summit alongside &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins.io/&#34;&gt;Jenkins&lt;/a&gt;. In the morning, there will be presentations by the core contributors of both projects. These will highlight the mission, goals and future direction of each project, as well as how community members can contribute. In the afternoon, there will be breakout Birds-of-a-Feather sessions for deeper discussion and collaboration with Jenkins X contributors. Bring your laptop, ideas and questions, and be ready for some hacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve had &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins.io/blog/2018/10/18/contributor-summit-summary/&#34;&gt;a fantastic time at past contributor summits&lt;/a&gt;, focused on Jenkins, and look forward to seeing you at this year&amp;rsquo;s Jenkins X Contributor Summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today’s technology landscape, people find it difficult to get up to speed with technologies for many reasons.  One reason that comes to mind is time.  Another may be that  some folks are just not able to read a tutorial or blog post and be successful at ramping up with a specific technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So these individuals need either a bootcamp or to sit and watch live demos and have someone explain concepts.  It is for these reasons that Oscar and Andrew &lt;a href=&#34;https://sched.co/VFHj&#34;&gt;will be introducing Jenkins X&lt;/a&gt; to people that might have heard of it, but have not yet had a chance to play with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Folks will be introduced to Jenkins X with simplicity in mind.  The speakers will walk through all the concepts of the platform. To make things fun, and easier to follow - the speakers plan to carry out the session in the form of a skit in which one speaker is an IT person from a fictitious company, and the other is the Jenkins X Expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will not want to miss this session if you are considering using a Kubernetes native CI/CD that abstracts you from the complexities of Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 4, 2019, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/abayer&#34;&gt;Andrew Bayer&lt;/a&gt; and I, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SharePointOscar&#34;&gt;@sharePointOscar&lt;/a&gt; will be speaking more on this topic at DevOps World | Jenkins World Lisbon. Join us if you&amp;rsquo;d like to hear more on this topic.  Use &lt;strong&gt;JWFOSS&lt;/strong&gt; for 30% discount on &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.cvent.com/event/94fdc1a9-a1d1-46d6-9085-b995bf895d0b/regProcessStep1?RefId=web&#34;&gt;registration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew and I look forward to helping you get to know Jenkins X!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blog: CFP: CI/CD Devroom at FOSDEM 2020</title>
      <link>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2019/10/09/fosdem2020/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2019/10/09/fosdem2020/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://fosdem.org/2020/&#34;&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/a&gt; is a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas, and collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/images/community/events/2020-fosdem.png&#34; class=&#34;img-thumbnail&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time, there will be a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) devroom at FOSDEM! The CI/CD devroom will take place on &lt;strong&gt;2nd of February 2020 in Brussels, Belgium&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fosdem&#34;&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://fosdem.org/2020/about/&#34;&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/a&gt; (Free and Open source Software Developers’ European Meeting) is a non-commercial, volunteer-organized European event centered on free and open source software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is aimed at developers and anyone interested in the free and open source software movement. FOSDEM will take place on 1st and 2nd of February in Brussels, Belgium. See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://fosdem.org/2020/&#34;&gt;event site for more details&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-the-cicd-devroom&#34;&gt;About the CI/CD Devroom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CI/CD devroom focuses on Free and Open Source CI/CD tools and software at large, and is not specific to Jenkins X. We think it is very important for creators and users of CI/CD tools to share ideas, best practices, and stories from the trenches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real examples are always inspiring and full of insights, even when things don&amp;rsquo;t go perfectly. We&amp;rsquo;d love to hear about interesting use-cases for CI/CD tools and pipelines. Also, talks on changing tools, either from proprietary to open source or between FOSS solutions, and the reasons why, can illuminate the differences between CI/CD tools and what users really want and need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;call-for-participation&#34;&gt;Call for Participation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talks can be on anything related to open source CI/CD tools and software!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please submit your proposals through FOSDEM&amp;rsquo;s pentabarf system at &lt;a href=&#34;https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM20&#34;&gt;https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM20&lt;/a&gt;. If you already have an account, please use the same as they show speakers&amp;rsquo; participation across the editions.  Take your time to fill up the fields, especially the descriptions, as that will be shown on FOSDEM website and booklets. Talks can be either 20 or 50 minutes, including time for questions and discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember to select the &amp;ldquo;Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment devroom&amp;rdquo; track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the talks will be recorded and made available under a Creative Commons license on the FOSDEM website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;important-dates&#34;&gt;Important Dates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deadline for submission of proposals is &lt;strong&gt;30th November, 2019&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final schedule for the CI/CD devroom at FOSDEM 2020 will be announced on 15th of December, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you have any issues or questions, contact &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:ci-cd-devroom-manager@fosdem.org&#34;&gt;ci-cd-devroom-manager@fosdem.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re excited to hear all the talks and discussions in the CI/CD devroom and look forward to seeing you there!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blog: Outreachy</title>
      <link>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2019/10/01/outreachy2019/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2019/10/01/outreachy2019/</guid>

        &lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/images/community/events/outreachy.png&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X is happy to announce our participation in the Outreachy program running from December 2019 to March 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outreachy helps people from groups underrepresented in free and open source software get involved by providing &amp;ldquo;a supportive community for beginning to contribute any time throughout the year and offer focused internship opportunities twice a year with a number of free software organizations.” The internships are for three-months, during which mentees work on specific projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organisations that participate in Outreachy include Apache, CNCF Tracing, Mozilla, GNOME, the Linux Kernel, GNU Guix, Wikimedia, Debian, Git, Tekton, Jenkins, and Jenkins X. These organisations outline specific projects for the interns to work on and provide remote mentors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please see &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.outreachy.org/&#34;&gt;Outreachy&amp;rsquo;s site&lt;/a&gt; for more information about the program, such as its purpose, eligibility requirements, and how to apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;about-jenkins-x&#34;&gt;About Jenkins X&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X is an open source, opinionated way to do continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) on Kubernetes. As such, it provides a modern, best practices approach to CI/CD for cloud native applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X aids developers in provisioning Kubernetes clusters, automates CI/CD, provides different virtual environments for development, staging, and production using Kubernetes namespaces, and provides preview environments for pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;jenkins-x-projects-for-outreachy&#34;&gt;Jenkins X projects for Outreachy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.outreachy.org/apply/project-selection/#jenkins-x&#34;&gt;Jenkins X has two projects for Outreachy applicants&lt;/a&gt; to engage with:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-primary&#34; role=&#34;alert&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a Cloud Storage backed Helm repository for Jenkins X, replacing ChartMuseum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentor: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/fere0010&#34;&gt;Hardy Ferentschik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the Jenkins X workflow, Helm charts are created which need to be deployed and made available. This project would replace &lt;a href=&#34;https://chartmuseum.com/&#34;&gt;ChartMuseum&lt;/a&gt; with a cloud storage bucket to host and serve Helm charts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-primary&#34; role=&#34;alert&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve the Jenkins X Apps Framework&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentor: David Conde&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jenkins X Apps Framework is a mechanism used to extend the functionality of Jenkins X. The goal of this project is to improve the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/docs/contributing/addons/&#34;&gt;Apps Framework User Guide&lt;/a&gt; and to create a Jenkins X app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Blog: Jenkins X Key Takeaways from Jenkins World 2019</title>
      <link>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2019/09/03/jenkinsworld-2019-takeaways/</link>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Jenkins X was the star of the show at DevOps World | Jenkins World 2019. In this article I will
share with you the dozen key things I learned about this exciting new cloud native CI/CD tool.
Beyond its capabilities as a CI/CD tool, Jenkins X also provides an excellent example of how to architect
a cloud native application on Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X is a completely new CI/CD system that shares little but its name with the existing Jenkins. Jenkins X incorporates the best practices from the &lt;em&gt;State of DevOps&lt;/em&gt; reports and the seminal book, &lt;em&gt;Accelerate&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/nicolefv&#34;&gt;Nicole Forsgren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jezhumble&#34;&gt;Jez Humble&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/RealGeneKim&#34;&gt;Gene Kim&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img width=&#34;70%&#34; height=&#34;70%&#34; alt=&#34;Capabilities of Jenkins X&#34; src=&#34;https://www.cloudbees.com/sites/default/files/jenkinsx_capabilities.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended multiple presentations by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jstrachan&#34;&gt;James Strachan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/abayer&#34;&gt;Andrew Bayer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jdrawlings&#34;&gt;James Rawlings&lt;/a&gt; of CloudBees, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/salaboy&#34;&gt;Mauricio Salatino&lt;/a&gt;. Mr. Rawlings even gave two presentations. Each presentation covered Jenkins X from a different perspective, so here I compose everything into a unified summary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;setting-up-kubernetes&#34;&gt;Setting up Kubernetes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cb-technologists.github.io/posts/gitops-series-part-1/&#34;&gt;Terraform is recommended&lt;/a&gt; for
setting up the required Kubernetes cluster and storage buckets. As explained below, you may find it
useful to run &lt;code&gt;jx boot&lt;/code&gt; from within Terraform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, Terraform stores its state in local file &lt;code&gt;terraform.tfstate&lt;/code&gt;. In an ephemeral cloud
environment, this state gets lost and you would create a new cluster each time you applied
Terraform. Remedy this by specifying a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/index.html&#34;&gt;Terraform backend&lt;/a&gt; to store the state in more durable storage like Google Cloud Storage or
Amazon S3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presenters recommended nginx as an ingress controller and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cb-technologists.github.io/posts/gitops-series-part-1/&#34;&gt;cert-manager&lt;/a&gt; to manage TLS
(HTTPS SSL) certificates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For introspection, navigation and object management of your Kubernetes cluster, try
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vmware/octant&#34;&gt;VMWare&amp;rsquo;s Octant UI tool&lt;/a&gt;. It runs on your local client just like
&lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt;. An advantage of Octant is that it authenticates the same way as &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt;: if &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt; works, octant works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;setting-up-jenkins-x&#34;&gt;Setting up Jenkins X&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a stable build of Jenkins X, get the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cloudbees.com/products/cloudbees-jenkins-x-distribution&#34;&gt;CloudBees Jenkins X Distribution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X has two modes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Static traditional Jenkins master with Jenkins pipelines. Use this if you want to continue
using your existing Jenkinsfiles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jenkins X pipelines based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline&#34;&gt;Tekton pipelines&lt;/a&gt;.
This is now the default, and is recommended for the long term. This mode is controlled by
the new &lt;code&gt;jenkins-x.yml&lt;/code&gt; file, whose syntax resembles the Jenkinsfile declarative pipeline
syntax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two interactive quick start commands. The older and presumably more stable is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;jx create quickstart
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new way to install, configure and upgrade Jenkins X is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;jx boot
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;jx boot&lt;/code&gt; interactively queries the user for the required setup data, recording the responses in file &lt;code&gt;jx-requirements.yml&lt;/code&gt;. It is re-entrant so you can run it repeatedly. Running &lt;code&gt;jx boot&lt;/code&gt; from within Terraform is a useful technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X evolves quickly, so &lt;code&gt;jx boot&lt;/code&gt; records the Jenkinx X version to use in field
&lt;code&gt;versionStream&lt;/code&gt; within &lt;code&gt;jx-requirements.yml&lt;/code&gt;. This establishes the version to use on subsequent
invocations of &lt;code&gt;jx boot&lt;/code&gt;. Update &lt;code&gt;versionStream&lt;/code&gt; when you want to start using a newer version of
Jenkins X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-status&#34;&gt;Getting status&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get logs using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;jx get build logs
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Track execution with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;jx get activity
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;List preview environments using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;jx get environments
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;basic-concepts-in-jenkins-x-pipelines&#34;&gt;Basic concepts in Jenkins X pipelines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point a little vocabulary lession is in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step&#34;&gt;Step&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A step is a command that runs in a separate container, sharing a workspace with other steps. Once a step fails, subsequent steps will not run. Step names must be unique within a stage. There is also a loop step, which runs the same command for each value in a list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the usual Kubernetes container configuration of resources, limits, volume mounts and so on are available within steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;stage&#34;&gt;Stage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stage is a unit of work in a pipeline. A stage contains either steps or nested stages. Each stage with steps runs in its own pod. The workspace is copied from one stage&amp;rsquo;s pod to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pipeline&#34;&gt;Pipeline&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two types of pipelines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Release pipelines merge into master, create a release and trigger promotion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the name implies, pull request pipelines are used to create a merge request preview environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pipeline is controlled by a &lt;code&gt;jenkins-x.yml&lt;/code&gt; file at the top of the source control repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;meta-pipeline&#34;&gt;Meta pipeline&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X has a bootstrapping problem: how to create a pipeline? The meta pipeline creates the real pipeline, sort of like Maven &lt;code&gt;release:prepare&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;defining-pipelines&#34;&gt;Defining pipelines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three ways to define a Jenkins X pipeline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatically via a build pack. The build pack automatically detects the source code language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specify a build pack and then override portions of it in &lt;code&gt;jenkins-x.yml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fully define an entirely new pipeline in &lt;code&gt;jenkins-x.yml&lt;/code&gt;. This is only useful for a pipeline
that will not be reused. For reusable pipelines, define a build pack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build packs are standard, opinionated pipelines for languages. They consist of a predefined
sequence of steps that run in a consistent order. They are similar to stages in that they can be
overridden and extended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X is controlled by a &lt;code&gt;jenkins-x.yml&lt;/code&gt; file that lives at the root of the Git repository.
In &lt;code&gt;jenkins-x.yml&lt;/code&gt;, you can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Override build packs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run steps before existing step using setup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;type: replace&lt;/code&gt; to replace a step&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To add a step to the end of the stage, leave the step name unspecified&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To apply an override to all pipelines, leave the pipeline name unspecified&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modify container configuration or environment variables. Override environment variables
using the same syntax as Kubernetes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also define a completely new pipeline in &lt;code&gt;jenkins-x.yml&lt;/code&gt;, but this is useful chiefly for debugging and testing. Again, make a pipeline reusable by defining it as a build pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;default-pipeline&#34;&gt;Default pipeline&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pull request and release pipelines are often very similar, so define common attributes for both
in a default pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;validating-syntax-and-ide-autocompletion&#34;&gt;Validating syntax and IDE autocompletion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check your pipelines using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;jx step syntax validate
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pipelines are usually defined by multiple YAML files. See how they fit together in a single flat pipeline file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;jx step syntax effective
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jenkins X YAML schema is uploaded to &lt;a href=&#34;https://schemastore.org&#34;&gt;schemastore.org&lt;/a&gt;, where amazingly IntelliJ and the VS Code YAML Language Extension automatically pick it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gitops-prow-and-lighthouse&#34;&gt;GitOps, Prow and Lighthouse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitOps is at the core of Jenkins X. GitOps extends Infrastructure as code by using pull requests to manage infrastructure changes. These pull requests might be created by developers, or they might be generated automatically by tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, Jenkins X creates a preview environment for each run of a pull request pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X currently uses Prow as a webhook handler and ChatOps engine for pull requests. Importantly, &lt;strong&gt;at this time Prow supports only GitHub.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Jenkins X uses only a small portion of Prow, and since Prow supports only GitHub, the
Jenkins X team is developing &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/lighthouse&#34;&gt;Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; as a
lightweight replacement. In this very experimental webhook handler, the Git provider is factored
out so that new providers can be easily added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, adding a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/go-scm&#34;&gt;new Git provider for Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; would be an excellent way to learn the Go language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;avoiding-committing-secrets&#34;&gt;Avoiding committing secrets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be difficult to avoid commiting secrets to Git. Thus separate file &lt;code&gt;parameters.yml&lt;/code&gt; contains URL references to a secret. Also, Jenkins X runs Helm in a temporary directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Helm chart &lt;code&gt;values.yml&lt;/code&gt; files are separated into individual &lt;code&gt;values.tmpl.yml&lt;/code&gt; files. These are templates so you can easily interpolate secrets into them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;implementing-https-in-preview-environments&#34;&gt;Implementing HTTPS in preview environments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to get HTTPS to work in preview environments because each preview environment gets a different URL. James Rawlings demonstrated the solution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specify that you want to use DNS for HTTPS in &lt;code&gt;jx boot&lt;/code&gt;. This will cause &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-dns&#34;&gt;external-dns&lt;/a&gt; to be installed automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;externalDNS&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;requirements.yml&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ingress:
  externalDNS: true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, create the domain (this example assumes you are using GKE):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;jx create domain gke --domain rawlingsdemo.co.uk
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, go to your domain registrar and replace their name servers with Google&amp;rsquo;s name servers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-jenkins-x-in-multiple-clusters&#34;&gt;Using Jenkins X in multiple clusters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strictly speaking, Jenkins X does not require its own cluster, but things work better operationally if you use separate clusters for testing, staging and production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You only need to install Jenkins X on the development cluster. Install the Jenkins X &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x-charts/environment-controller&#34;&gt;environment controller&lt;/a&gt; on the staging and production clusters. This is further explained in the article &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/getting-started/multi-cluster/&#34;&gt;Multiple Clusters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;upcoming-jenkins-x-features&#34;&gt;Upcoming Jenkins X features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X is evolving rapidly. Upcoming features are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conditional execution of stages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jenkins X apps to inject steps and stages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More advanced configuration of stage pods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More advanced solution for pipeline and stage sharing across repos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;learning-jenkins-x&#34;&gt;Learning Jenkins X&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many fine examples with source code on GitHub were presented:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mauricio Salatino presented what was by far
&lt;a href=&#34;https://salaboy.com/2019/08/12/building-cloud-native-platforms-with-jenkins-x/&#34;&gt;the most extensive example&lt;/a&gt;.
Starting with a monolithic application, he decomposed it into microservices, built it with
Jenkins X and deployed it on Kubernetes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For instruction on how to use Kubernetes itself, Mauricio recommends
&lt;a href=&#34;https://learnk8s.io/academy/&#34;&gt;learnk8s.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kurt Madel&amp;rsquo;s CloudBees Technologists Group gave
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cb-technologists.github.io/posts/lightning-talks-dw-jw-2019/&#34;&gt;several lightning talks&lt;/a&gt;
that discuss Jenkins X.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cb-technologists.github.io/posts/gitops-series-part-1/&#34;&gt;GitOps for Jenkins Infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;
contains great Terraform tips for regular Jenkins (not Jenkins X). Whether or not you really
want to use GitOps for your blog,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cb-technologists/blog&#34;&gt;GitOps for Blogging, Why Not?&lt;/a&gt;
demonstrates GitOps principles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-involved-with-the-jenkins-community&#34;&gt;Getting involved with the Jenkins Community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple presenters recommended the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/community/&#34;&gt;Jenkins X Slack channels&lt;/a&gt; as the best source of help and information. For more ways to get involved, see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/community/&#34;&gt;Jenkins X community page&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ll see you there.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Back in March 2018, the Jenkins X project burst onto the scene as the Jenkins counterpart for automated CI/CD for Kubernetes. As part of that launch featured the logo: a variation of the Jenkins logo, featuring a pipe-smoking ship captain with Kubernetes logo on his cap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In software, we like to say that naming is hard - because it is. Another thing that is also hard is trying to capture the essence of a project in a logo. Logos pack a lot of meaning into a small space. Icons, such as the Jenkins logo, establish a strong emotional connection with many developers. So with that in mind we always listened closely to feedback on the new logo and how people perceive the project as a result of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-we-are-changing-the-logo&#34;&gt;Why we are changing the logo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In listening to various types of feedback from all sorts of different sources we heard many positive things but also some problems and confusion were highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not everyone was a fan of the logo and we heard quite a few comments back about aspects that people didn’t like about it, with the ‘pipe-smoking’ featuring high on that list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confusion with Jenkins project - we also saw that the logo was more in keeping with A other Jenkins mascots, which led to confusion about what kind of project Jenkins X is - some perceived it as another plugin in the ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also heard that use of the Kubernetes logo was confusing or perhaps not completely within the remit of the Kubernetes logo guidelines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From a practical perspective we also heard that the logo was too detailed and as a result would not work well as an icon, especially for a favicon. It  was seen as more of a mascot than a logo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the setup of the CD.Foundation and Jenkins X being one of the founding projects, distinct from Jenkins, we felt the time was right to address this feedback. So we literally went back to the drawing board to think about what logo could better represent Jenkins X as a project. We thought about what we want people to associate with the project: open source, continuous delivery, speed, automation, stability, teams, etc. We also wanted a logo that could improve representation, so we wanted to avoid a human-based logo that might inadvertently encode gender, age and other factors. Additionally, the &amp;lsquo;X&amp;rsquo; has become a distinct part of the project&amp;rsquo;s identity and so we wanted to really emphasize it in the new logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;designing-the-new-logo--community-feedback&#34;&gt;Designing the new logo &amp;amp; community feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately we focussed on trying to visualize speed and automation which led to the idea of a robot. However, we still wanted to have a nod to the original Jenkins project featured in the logo somehow or the other. We explicitly decided to not stick with the nautical theme traditionally associated with Kubernetes and related projects. We went through a few iterations, refining and cutting down details as we went. The design effort was a close partnership with Craig Ross, Creative Director at the Linux Foundation and his team, who also produced the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cd.foundation/&#34;&gt;CD Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, CNCF, Network Service Mesh, and Tekton brands.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the core Jenkins X team had settled on a design they were happy with, we took it to the community for feedback and to address some of the details. We had alot of feedback, including all the things it reminded folks of (an upside-down koala, Bill Nye, Reddit logo, Flash Gordon, Tekton logo, etc). One overarching consistent theme about the original design was that it did not reflect the friendliness of the community. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/4144#issuecomment-497787629&#34;&gt;Kyounger&lt;/a&gt; in particular helped analyse this reaction and went the extra mile to propose a solution. We agreed and loved this suggestion and fed this back into the final version of the logo. Thanks alot Kenny &amp;amp; open source FTW!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jenkins--jenkins-x&#34;&gt;Jenkins &amp;amp; Jenkins X&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X started life as a Jenkins subproject and is now an independent project with the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF). The bowtie in the new logo is an ever-present reminder of that provenance. Even though our logo and branding may be changing, under the umbrella of the CDF, we continue to work closely with the Jenkins project, sharing that same spirit of service towards developers’ CI/CD and productivity needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rolling-out-the-new-logo&#34;&gt;Rolling out the new logo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have now started switching over to the new logo and expect to see some new swag available soon too. The old logo we will now consider as a mascot of the Jenkins X project. If you are looking to update your use of the logo, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cdfoundation/artwork&#34;&gt;here is the new artwork&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/news/new-logo-jenkins-x/jenkinsx-stacked-color.png&#34;&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It is a big change for the project but ultimately the reason we put so much time and energy into this is that is important to us we represent the spirit of Jenkins X in everything we do. So when you are using Jenkins X, and you see the new logo, we want you to feel part of the open and friendly community and we want your team to focus on what you really want to focus on: delivering quality software at speed and at any scale.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blog: Increasing CI/CD Pipeline Observability in Jenkins X</title>

&lt;h5&gt;Increasing CI/CD Pipeline Observability, implement tracing&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might have heard of Observability given that folks have been talking about this for a while now.  Sure, you might think it is just the latest tech buzzword.  However, the practice has been around for a long time now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observability is certainly relevant today given the Microservices architectures, distributed systems, and the characteristics of modern applications being deployed at a faster pace by leveraging CI/CD pipelines to Kubernetes, in this case using Jenkins X.  Indeed old practices of setting up monitoring after an app is deployed, are no longer acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it, modern apps call for modern instrumentation, not only once they are deployed; even at build-time having proper instrumentation can help you gain insights into what is happening at various stages of the build and release process. This may include spotting any latency issues, performance and dependency download times.  In other words, instrumentation and monitoring should be baked into our deployment pipeline in Jenkins X!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that Jenkins X is the native CI/CD platform for Kubernetes, we must start thinking of Observability in the context of the build and release of our containerized applications via this platform, and not after the deployment process itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-we-are-doing-today&#34;&gt;What we are doing today&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I walk you through the process of increasing observability in your build and release pipeline by implementing tracing for a couple of events such as &lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;npm test&lt;/code&gt; which are part of a sample NodeJS application.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-primary&#34; role=&#34;alert&#34;&gt;

NOTE: Tracing is only a small portion of other things that need to be in place.  Logging and Metrics are also required.  The combination and aggregation of this data allows you to understand how observable your pipeline is.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Metrics, Logs, Traces are all needed.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;leveraging-third-party-tools&#34;&gt;Leveraging Third-Party Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X was built with extensibility and flexibility in mind.  Today, you can easily create &lt;strong&gt;QuickStarts&lt;/strong&gt; for a language not implemented.  You can also build &lt;strong&gt;addOns&lt;/strong&gt; to augment the platform functionality.  There are currently &lt;strong&gt;addOns&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;code&gt;istio&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;prometheus&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;anchore&lt;/code&gt; to name a few.  Given this extensibility, we encourage our community to build these components and share with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look around, you’ll find that &lt;a href=&#34;http://Honeycomb.io&#34;&gt;Honeycomb.io&lt;/a&gt; is at the forefront of Observability.  We are collaborating with them to eventually have a &lt;em&gt;Honeycomb addOn&lt;/em&gt; for Jenkins X&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, we use the Honeycomb.io API to trace our pipeline events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tracing-cicd-pipeline-events&#34;&gt;Tracing CI/CD Pipeline Events&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this scenario we want to trace start and end times for certain events.  In our example NodeJS app, we have commands such as &lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;npm test&lt;/code&gt;, which are part of our &lt;strong&gt;build-pack&lt;/strong&gt; pipeline out of the box.  To do start tracing, we modify the Tekton pipeline and inject calls to the Honeycomb.io API before and after these specific &lt;strong&gt;build pack&lt;/strong&gt; named steps.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-primary&#34; role=&#34;alert&#34;&gt;

NOTE: Please be sure to sign up for &lt;a href=&#34;http://honeycomb.io&#34;&gt;honeycomb.io&lt;/a&gt; to obtain your &lt;strong&gt;API Key&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;create-kubernetes-secret&#34;&gt;Create Kubernetes Secret&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have our API Key, we want to create a Kubernetes Secret which is required to make API calls within our pipeline.  To do this, we create it in the &lt;code&gt;jx&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;jx-staging&lt;/code&gt; namespaces.  For each namespace execute the following command (be sure to modify the namespace value as needed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;kubectl create secret generic honeycomb-creds —from-literal&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;BUILDEVENT_APIKEY&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;KEY&amp;gt; --namespace&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;NAMESPACE&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;modify-tekton-pipeline&#34;&gt;Modify Tekton Pipeline&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have our Kubernetes Secret in place, we will modify the &lt;code&gt;jenkins-x.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file, which currently has exactly one line as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;buildpack&lt;/span&gt;: javascript
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s go over the important components of the YAML file once modified.  The first items I&amp;rsquo;d like to highlight, are the environment variables needed.  We need to provide honeycomb.io three key pieces of information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CI Provider&lt;/strong&gt;:  this is the JENKINS-X environment variable.  Honeycomb will add additional metadata fields to our dataset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUILDEVENT_DATASET&lt;/strong&gt;: this indicates which dataset we want to populate (you can have many).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUILDEVENT_APIKEY&lt;/strong&gt;: the Kubernetes Secret value, which is the API Key provided via the honeycomb site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;buildPack&lt;/span&gt;: javascript
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;pipelineConfig&lt;/span&gt;:
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;:
  - &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;: JENKINS-X
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;: JENKINS-X
  - &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;: BUILDEVENT_DATASET
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;: jx
  - &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;: BUILDEVENT_APIKEY
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;valueFrom&lt;/span&gt;:
      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;secretKeyRef&lt;/span&gt;:
        &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;: BUILDEVENT_APIKEY
        &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;: honeycomb-creds

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;build-pack&lt;/strong&gt; used for a NodeJS app is &lt;strong&gt;javascript&lt;/strong&gt; as detected by the language.  Hence, why the single line we had as the contents of the &lt;code&gt;jenkins-x.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we know which build-pack is being used, we can determine which named steps exist.  As you can imagine, a typical &lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;npm test&lt;/code&gt; typically exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we want to inject a timestamp &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; each of these named steps are called.  The following shows how I inject this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;pipelines&lt;/span&gt;:
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;overrides&lt;/span&gt;:
    - &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;: npm-install
      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;pipeline&lt;/span&gt;: pullRequest
      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;stage&lt;/span&gt;: build
      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;:
      - &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;: echo ===== pullrequest:build:before  sending honeycomb step trace  ===============

      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;: after
    - &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;: npm-test
      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;pipeline&lt;/span&gt;: pullRequest

      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;:
      - &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;: honeycomb-npm-test-set-step-start-timestamp
        &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;: echo $(date +%s) &amp;gt; step_start
      - &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;: honeycomb-npm-test-before-timestamp

    - &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;: npm-test
      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;pipeline&lt;/span&gt;: pullRequest
      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;stage&lt;/span&gt;: build
      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;:
      - &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;: honeycomb-npm-test-after-timestamp
        &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;: echo =================================  $(cat step_start)  =================================
      - &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;: honeycomb-step-log-after-npm-test
        &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;: ./buildevents step &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;${APP_NAME}-${PULL_NUMBER}-${VERSION}-${BUILD_NUMBER}&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; $(echo npm-test | sum | cut -f &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; -d \ ) $(cat step_start) npm-test
      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;: after

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that I have  captured timestamps for these two named steps, I want to send an API call to honeycomb as follows.  You will notice how I am using a binary called &lt;strong&gt;buildevents&lt;/strong&gt; this is downloaded during the setup of my pipelines which I discuss shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By concatenating a few metadata pieces that exist as &lt;strong&gt;environment variables&lt;/strong&gt; in Jenkins X, I build a unique name which is needed by honeycomb to track things correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;    - &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;pipeline&lt;/span&gt;: pullRequest
      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;stage&lt;/span&gt;: build
      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;:
      - &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;: honeycomb-build-name-concat
        &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;: echo the build is &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;${APP_NAME}-${PULL_NUMBER}-${VERSION}-${BUILD_NUMBER}&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; and HONEYCOMB_BUILD_START=$(cat build_start)
      - &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;: honeycomb-send-success
        &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt;: ./buildevents build &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;${APP_NAME}-${PULL_NUMBER}-${VERSION}-${BUILD_NUMBER}&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; $(cat build_start) success

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the Build Events binary provided by Honeycomb, make it executable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create the timestamp we will use to track the &lt;strong&gt;pullRequest&lt;/strong&gt; pipeline execution.  I do this by saving a temporary file with the timestamp.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once this pipeline executes, the dashboard on the honeycomb.io site will show us the execution tracing as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/news/jenkins-x-observability/honeycomb_trace_example.png&#34; alt=&#34;Honeycomb Dashboard&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we have a unique name for our build being traced, underneath that we are tracking the two events &lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;npm test&lt;/code&gt; time spans.  We can easily see how long our dependencies are taking to download, and how long does it take to run the tests for the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I’ve enticed you to at least look into why you might consider incorporating observability into your build and release process. There is a lot more that can be done.  In a future post, we will cover additional setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;using-jenkins-x-to-define-and-run-serverless-deployments&#34;&gt;Using Jenkins X To Define And Run Serverless Deployments&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-serverless-computing&#34;&gt;What is Serverless Computing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand serverless computing, one needs to understand the challenges we are facing with more &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; types of deployments of our applications. A long time ago, most of us were deploying our apps directly to servers. We had to decide the size (memory and CPU) of the nodes where our applications would run, we had to create those servers, and we had to maintain them. The situation improved with the emergence of cloud computing. We still had to do all those things, but now those tasks were much easier due to the simplicity of the APIs and services cloud vendors gave us. Suddenly, we had (a perception of) infinite resources and all we had to do is run a command, and a few minutes later the servers (VMs) we needed would materialize. Things become much easier and faster. But, that did not remove the tasks of creating and maintaining servers. Instead, that made them more straightforward. Concepts like immutability become mainstream as well. As a result, we got much-needed reliability, reduced drastically lean time, and started to rip benefits of elasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, some important questions were left unanswered. Should we keep our servers running even when our applications are not serving any requests? If we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t, how can we ensure that they are readily available when we do need them? Who should be responsible for the maintenance of those servers? Is it our infrastructure department, our cloud provider, or can we build a system that will do that for us without human intervention?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things changed with the emergence of containers and schedulers. After a few years of uncertainty created by having too many options on the table, the situation stabilized around Kubernetes that become the de-facto standard. At roughly the same time, in parallel with the rise of popularity of containers and schedulers, solutions for serverless computing concepts started to materialize. Those solutions were not related to each other or, to be more precise, they were not during the first few years. Kubernetes provided us with means to run microservices as well as more traditional types of applications, while serverless focused on running functions (often only a few lines of code).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name serverless is misleading by giving the impression that they are no servers involved. They are certainly still there, but the concept and the solutions implementing them allow us (users) to ignore their existence. The major cloud providers (AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google) all came up with solutions for serverless computing. Developers could focus on writing functions with a few additional lines of code specific to our serverless computing vendor. Everything else required for running and scaling those functions become transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not everything is excellent in the serverless world. The number of use-cases that can be fulfilled with writing functions (as opposed to applications) is limited. Even when we do have enough use-cases to make serverless computing worthwhile effort, a more significant concern is lurking just around the corner. We are likely going to be locked to a vendor given that none of them implements any type of industry standard. No matter whether we choose AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions, the code we write will not be portable from one vendor to another. That does not mean that there are no serverless frameworks that are not tied to a specific cloud provider. There are, but we&amp;rsquo;d need to maintain them ourselves, be it on-prem or inside clusters running in a public cloud. That removes one of the most essential benefits of serverless concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s where Kuberentes comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;serverless-deployments-in-kubernetes&#34;&gt;Serverless Deployments In Kubernetes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I must make an assumption that you, dear reader, might dissagree with. Most of the companies will run at least some (if not all) of their applications in Kubernetes. It is becoming (or it already is) a standard API that will be used by (almost) everyone. Why is that assumption important? If I am right, then (almost) everyone will have a Kubernetes cluster. Everyone will spend time maintaining it, and everyone will have some level of in-house knowledge of how it works. If that assumption is correct, it stands to reason that Kubernetes would be the best choice of a platform to run serverless applications as well. That would avoid vendor lock-in since Kubernetes can run (almost) anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes-based serverless computing would provide quite a few other benefits. We could be free to write our applications in any language, instead of being limited by those supported by function-as-a-service solutions offered by cloud vendors. Also, we would not be limited to writing only functions. A microservice or even a monolith could run as a serverless application. We just need to find a solution to make that happen. After all, proprietary cloud-specific serverless solutions use containers (of sorts) as well, and the standard mechanism for running containers is Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an increasing number of Kubernetes platforms that allow us to run serverless applications. We won&amp;rsquo;t go into all of those, but fastrack the conversation by me stating that Knative is likely going to become the de-facto standard how to deploy serverless load to Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://knative.dev/&#34;&gt;Knative&lt;/a&gt; is an open source project that delivers components used to build and run serverless applications on Kubernetes. We can use it to scale-to-zero, to autoscale, for in-cluster builds, and as an eventing framework for applications on Kubernetes. The part of the project we&amp;rsquo;re interested in right now is its ability to convert our applications into serverless deployments. That should allow us both to save resources (memory and CPU) when our applications are idle, as well as to scale them fast when trafic increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we discussed what is serverless and that I made an outlandish statement that Kubernetes is the platform where your serverless applications should be running, let&amp;rsquo;s talk which types of scenarios are a good fit for serverless deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;which-types-of-applications-should-run-as-serverless&#34;&gt;Which Types Of Applications Should Run As Serverless?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, the idea was to have only functions running as serverless loads. Those would be single-purpose pieces of code that contain only a small number of lines of code. A typical example of a serverless application would be an image processing function that responds to a single request and can run for a limited period. Restrictions like the size of applications (functions) and their maximum duration are imposed by implementations of serverless computing in cloud providers. But, if we adopt Kubernetes as the platform to run serverless deployments, those restrictions might not be valid anymore. We can say that any application that can be packaged into a container image can run as a serverless deployment in Kubernetes. That, however, does not mean that any container is as good of a candidate as any other. The smaller the application or, to be more precise, the faster its boot-up time is, the better the candidate for serverless deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, things are not as straight forward as they may seem. Not being a good candidate does not mean that one should not compete at all. Knative, as many other serverless frameworks do allow us to fine-tune configurations. We can, for example, specify with Knative that there should never be less than one replica of an application. That would solve the problem of slow boot-up while still maintaining some of the benefits of serverless deployments. In such a case, there would always be at least one replica to handle requests, while we would benefit from having the elasticity of serverless providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size and the booot-up time are not the only criteria we can use to decide whether an application should be serverless or not. We might want to consider traffic as well. If, for example, our app has high traffic and it receives requests throughout the whole day, we might never need to scale it down to zero replicas. Similarly, our application might not be designed in a way that every request is processed by a different replica. After all, most of the apps can handle a vast number of requests by a single replica. In such cases, serverless computing implemented by cloud vendors and based on function-as-a-service might not be the right choice. But, as we already discussed, there are other serverless platforms, and those based on Kubernetes do not follow those rules. Since we can run any container as serverless, any type of applications can be deployed as such, and that means that a single replica can handle as many requests as its design allows. Also, Knative and other platforms can be configured to have a minimum number of replicas, so they might be well suited even for the applications with a constant flow of traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, if it can run in a container, it can be converted into a serverless deployment, as long as we understand that smaller applications with faster boot-up times are better candidates than others. If there is a rule we should follow when deciding whether to run an application as serverless, it is related to the state. Or, to be more precise, the luck of it. If an application is stateless, it might be the right candidate for serverless computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let us imagine that you have an application that is not the right candidate to be serverless. Does that mean that we cannot rip any benefit from frameworks like Knative? We can since there is still the question of deployments to different environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, we have permanent and temporary environments. The examples of the former would be staging and production. If we do not want our application to be serverless in production, we will probably not want it to be any different in staging. Otherwise, the behavior would be different, and we could not say that we tested precisely the same behavior as the one we expect to run in production. So, in most cases, if an application should not be serverless in production, it should not be serverless in any other permanent environment. But, that does not mean that it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be serverless in temporary environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take an environment in which we deploy an application as a result of making a pull request as an example. It would be a temporary environment since we&amp;rsquo;d remove it the moment that pull request is closed. Its time span is relatively short. It could exist for a few minutes, but sometimes that could be days or even weeks. It all depends on how fast we are in closing pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, there is a high chance that the application deployed in such temporary environment will have low trafic. We would typically run a set of automated tests when the pull request is created or when we make changes to it. That would certainly result in a traffic spike. But, after that, the traffic would be much lower and most of the time non-existent. We might open the application to have a look at it, we might run some manual tests, and then we would wait for the pull request to be approved or for someone to push additional changes if we found some issues or inconsistencies. That means that the deployment in question would be unused most of the time. Still, if it would be a &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; deployment, it would oocupy resources for no particular reason. That might even discourage us from making temporary environments due to high costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that  deployments based on pull requests are not used for final validations before deploying to production (that&amp;rsquo;s what permanent environments are for), we do not need to insist that they are the same as production. On the other hand, the applications in such environments are mostly unused. Those facts lead us to conclude that temporary (often pull-request based) environments are a great candidate for serverless deployments, no matter the deployment type we use in permanent environments (e.g., staging and production).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we saw some of the use cases for serverless computing, there is still an important one that we did not discuss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-do-we-need-jenkins-x-to-be-serverless&#34;&gt;Why Do We Need Jenkins X To Be Serverless?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few problems with the traditional Jenkins. Most of us already know them, so I&amp;rsquo;ll repeat them only briefly. Jenkins (without X) does not scale, it is not fault-tolerant, it&amp;rsquo;s resource usage is heavy, it is slow, it is not API-driven, and so on. In other words, it was not designed yesterday, but when those things were not as important as they are today. Jenkins had to go away for Jenkins X to take its place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, Jenkins X had a stripped-down version of Jenkins but, since the release 2, not a single line of the traditional Jenkins is left in Jenkins X. Now it is fully serverless thanks to Tekton and a lot of custom code written from scratch to support the need for a modern Kubernetes-based solution. Excluding a very thin layer that mostly acts as an API gateway, Jenkins X is fully serverless. Nothing runs when there are no builds, and it scales to accommodate any load. And that might be the best example of serverless computing we can have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous integration and continuous delivery flows are temporary by their nature. When we make a change to a Git repository, it notifies the cluster, and a set of processes are spun. Each Git webhook request results in a pipeline run that builds, validates, and deploys a new release and, once those processes are finished, it dissapears from the system. Nothing is executing when there are no pipeline runs, and we can have as many of them in parallel as we need. It is elastic and resource-efficient, and the heavy lifting is done by Tekton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous integration and continuous delivery tools are probably one of the best examples of a use-case that fits well in serverless computing concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-tekton-and-how-does-it-fix-jenkins-x&#34;&gt;What Is Tekton And How Does It Fix Jenkins X?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of you using serverless Jenkins X already experienced Knative, of sorts. Tekton is a spin-off project of Knative, and it is the essential component in the solution. It is in charge of creating pipeline runs (a special type of Pods) when needed and destroying them when finished. Thanks to Tekton, the total footprint of serverless Jenkins X is very small when idle. Similarly, it allows the solution to scale to almost any size when that is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tekton is designed only for &amp;ldquo;special&amp;rdquo; type of processes, mostly those associated with continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines. It is not, however, suited for long-running applications designed to handle requests. So, why am I talking about Tekton if it does not allow us to run our applications as serverless? The answer lies in Tekton&amp;rsquo;s father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tekton is a Knative spin-off. It was forked from it in hopes to provide better CI/CD capabilities. Or, to be more precise, Tekton was born out of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://knative.dev/docs/build/&#34;&gt;Knative Build&lt;/a&gt; component, which is now considered deprecated. But, Knative still stays the most promising way to run serverless applications in Kubernetes. It is the father of Tekton, which we&amp;rsquo;ve been using for a while now given that it is an integral part of serverless Jenkins X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I could walk you through the details of Knative definitions, but that would be out of the scope of this subject. It&amp;rsquo;s about Jenkins X, not about Knative and other platforms for running serverless application. But, my unwilingness to show you the ups and downs of Knative does not mean that we cannot use it. As a matter of fact, Jenkins X already provides means to select whether we want to create a quickstart or import an existing project that will be deployed as a serverless application using Knative. We just need to let Jenkins X know that&amp;rsquo;s what we want, and it&amp;rsquo;ll do the heavy lifing of creating the definition (YAML file) that we need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Jenkins X is an excellent example of both a set of serverless applications that constitute the solution, as well as a tool that allows us to convert our existing applications into serverless deployments. All we have to do to accomplish the latter is to express that as our desire, and Jenkins X will do all the heavy lifting of creating the correct definitions for our applications as well as to move them through their life cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/images/2019-dwjw-san-fran-rev.png&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for more opportunities to learn Jenkins and Jenkins X during the lunch hours while at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cloudbees.com/devops-world/san-francisco&#34;&gt;DevOps World | Jenkins World 2019 San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, come join us at the Jenkins and Jenkins X Community Booth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t yet have your pass for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cloudbees.com/devops-world/san-francisco&#34;&gt;DevOps World | Jenkins World 2019 San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, and don&amp;rsquo;t want to miss out on the fun, you can get yours using &lt;strong&gt;JWFOSS&lt;/strong&gt; for a 30% discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During lunch hours we are scheduling the following demo briefs at the Jenkins and Jenkins X Community Booth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday  August 14, 2019&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12:10 - 12:25pm Faster Git &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/MarkEWaite&#34;&gt;Mark Waite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will learn the techniques they can use with Jenkins to make their systems clone and update git repositories faster and with less disc space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12:25 - 12:40pm	Observability in Jenkins X	&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sharepointoscar&#34;&gt;Oscar Medina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are using Jenkins X, you’re already building at rapid pace.  However, most miss the opportunity to gain real insights into their build and release pipeline.  I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how you can increase observability by activating metric capture and analysis during a containerized application deployment with Jenkins X.  This  entails modifying the declarative Tekton pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12:40 - 12:55pm	Jenkins-Rest, A JClouds Java Library for the Jenkins REST API	&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/martinda&#34;&gt;Martin d&amp;rsquo;Anjou&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the Java-Rest library, we demonstrate how to submit a job to Jenkins, and track it to its completion, all from the command line, without ever touching the GUI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12:55 - 1:10pm DevOps without Quality: An IT Horror Story	Laura Keaton&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DevOps, the current IT Industry sweetheart, has a dark secret that has victimized organizations on their transformational journey. Investigate two case studies that left development and delivery teams in tatters and how quality engineering solutions could have prevented their disastrous outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:10 - 1:25pm	Securing Your Jenkins Container Pipeline with Open Source Tools	&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cwiens1211&#34;&gt;Christian Wiens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discuss the security pitfalls of containers and how embedding an open source image scanning and policy based compliance tool like Anchore into your CI/CD pipeline can mitigate this risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday  August 15, 2019&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12:25 - 12:40pm	Results from the 2019 Jenkins Google Summer of Code	&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/martinda&#34;&gt;Martin d&amp;rsquo;Anjou&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, the Jenkins project participated in the Google Summer of Code. This is an annual, international, program which encourages college-aged students to participate in open source projects during the summer break between classes. In 2019, we had dozens of applications and many student projects. In this session, we will showcase the students&amp;rsquo; projects and talk about what they bring to the Jenkins ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12:40 - 12:55pm	Sysdig Secure Jenkins Plugin	&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/markyjackson-taulia&#34;&gt;Marky Jackson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sysdig.com/products/secure&#34;&gt;Sysdig Secure&lt;/a&gt; is a container security platform that brings together docker image scanning and run-time protection to identify vulnerabilities, block threats, enforce compliance, and audit activity across your microservices. The Sysdig Secure Jenkins plugin can be used in a Pipeline job, or added as a build step to a Freestyle job, to automate the process of running an image analysis, evaluating custom policies against images, and performing security scans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12:55 - 1:10pm	Using React for plugin UI	&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jeffpearce&#34;&gt;Jeff Pearce&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The working hours plugin has a date driven UI. During this summer&amp;rsquo;s Google Summer of Code, our student rewrite the UI in React, so that we could take advantage open source modules such as calendar pickers. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about how the student approached the UI, demonstrate the UI and talk about particular challenges we faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:10 - 1:25pm	Jenkins GKE Plugin &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/craigdbarber&#34;&gt;Craig Barber&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this demo we will showcase the Jenkins GKE plugin, newest addition to GCP’s suite of officially supported plugins. We’ll show how to leverage this plugin to deploy applications built in Jenkins pipelines to multiple clusters running in GKE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grab your lunch and join us at the community theater!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Installing Jenkins X on Alibaba Cloud Container Service&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;installing-jenkins-x-in-alibaba-kubernetes-container-service&#34;&gt;Installing Jenkins X in Alibaba Kubernetes Container Service&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X has just added initial support to install in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/container-service&#34;&gt;Alibaba Container Service&lt;/a&gt;, its Kubernetes offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following instructions allow installation in a managed Kubernetes cluster in any region outside of mainland China, where more configuration is needed avoid using Google services blocked by chinese authorities (Docker images in GCR). There is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jenkins-x-platform/issues/5551&#34;&gt;pending issue&lt;/a&gt; for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;creating-a-kubernetes-cluster&#34;&gt;Creating a Kubernetes Cluster&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alibaba requires several things in order to create a Kubernetes cluster, so it is easier to do it through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cs.console.aliyun.com/&#34;&gt;web UI&lt;/a&gt; the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following services need to be activated: Container Service, Resource Orchestration Service (ROS), RAM, and Auto Scaling service, and created the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/86484.htm?spm=a2c63.p38356.b99.38.663a333eMXExon&#34;&gt;Container Service roles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to use the command line we can install the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aliyun/aliyun-cli&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;aliyun&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; cli. I have added all the steps needed below in case you want to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;brew install aliyun-cli
aliyun configure
REGION&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;ap-southeast-1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clusters need to be created in a VPC, so that needs to be created with VSwitches for each zone to be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;aliyun vpc CreateVpc &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;RequestId&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;89D9AB1F-B4AB-4B4B-8CAA-F68F84417502&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, a keypair (or password) is needed for the cluster instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;aliyun ecs ImportKeyPair &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    --KeyPairName jx &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    --RegionId &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;REGION&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    --PublicKeyBody &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last step is to create the cluster using the just created VPC, VSwitch and Keypair. It&amp;rsquo;s important to select the option &lt;em&gt;Expose API Server with EIP&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;code&gt;public_slb&lt;/code&gt; in the API json) to be able to connect to the API from the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can now download &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt; configuration with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;aliyun cs GET /k8s/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;CLUSTER&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;/user_config | jq -r .config &amp;gt; ~/.kube/config-alibaba

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another detail before being able to install applications that use &lt;code&gt;PersistentVolumeClaims&lt;/code&gt; is to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/86612.htm#a2c63.p38356.879954.i0.11497ec4J5rKJd&#34;&gt;configure a default storage class&lt;/a&gt;. There are several volume options that can be listed with &lt;code&gt;kubectl get storageclass&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;NAME                          PROVISIONER     AGE
alicloud-disk-available       alicloud/disk   44h
alicloud-disk-common          alicloud/disk   44h
alicloud-disk-efficiency      alicloud/disk   44h
alicloud-disk-ssd             alicloud/disk   44h
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of them matches the following cloud disks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;alicloud-disk-common: basic cloud disk (minimum size 5GiB). Only available in some zones (us-west-1a, cn-beijing-b,&amp;hellip;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;alicloud-disk-efficiency: high-efficiency cloud disk, ultra disk (minimum size 20GiB).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;alicloud-disk-ssd: SSD disk (minimum size 20GiB).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;alicloud-disk-available: provides highly available options, first attempts to create a high-efficiency cloud disk. If the corresponding AZ&amp;rsquo;s efficient cloud disk resources are sold out, tries to create an SSD disk. If the SSD is sold out, tries to create a common cloud disk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set SSDs as the default:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;kubectl patch storageclass alicloud-disk-ssd &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    -p &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;{&amp;#34;metadata&amp;#34;: {&amp;#34;annotations&amp;#34;: {&amp;#34;storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;true&amp;#34;}}}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: Alibaba cloud disks must be &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/25513.htm#h2-url-2&#34;&gt;more than 5GiB (basic) or 20GiB (SSD and Ultra)&lt;/a&gt;) so we will need to configure any service that is deployed with PVCs to have that size as a minimum or the &lt;code&gt;PersistentVolume&lt;/code&gt; provision will fail. The Jenkins X deployments &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/cloud-environments/blob/master/env-alibaba/myvalues.yaml&#34;&gt;are already configured with this in mind&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-jenkins-x&#34;&gt;Installing Jenkins X&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alibaba Kubernetes clusters won&amp;rsquo;t be able to pull images from the insecure docker registry included in Jenkins X, we need to use Alibaba&amp;rsquo;s Container Registry by going to &lt;a href=&#34;https://cr.console.aliyun.com&#34;&gt;https://cr.console.aliyun.com&lt;/a&gt; and setting a password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we need to create a Container Registry namespace that allows us to push any image and make them public by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the web UI we can create a Docker login password that we will be using later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;NAMESPACE&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;jenkins-x-&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;cat /dev/urandom | env LC_CTYPE&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;C tr -dc &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;a-z&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; | fold -w &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; | head -n 1&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;{
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;    &amp;#34;Namespace&amp;#34;: {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;        &amp;#34;Namespace&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;${NAMESPACE}&amp;#34;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;    }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;EOF&lt;/span&gt;
aliyun cr PUT /namespace &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;EOF&lt;/span&gt;

aliyun cr POST /namespace/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;NAMESPACE&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    --header &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Content-Type=application/json&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we can install Jenkins X as usual, passing the &lt;code&gt;--provider alibaba&lt;/code&gt; flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;jx install &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After installation we need to add the Container Registry credentials to the cluster, the Docker password we have previously created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-addons&#34;&gt;Installing Addons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addons can be installed normally with the caveat mentioned above about PVC minimum size. Which means that we may need to pass some Helm values to the &lt;code&gt;create addon&lt;/code&gt; command, depending on the chart we are installing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance to install Prometheus with 20Gi disks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;jx create addon prometheus &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    -s alertmanager.persistentVolume.size&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;20Gi,pushgateway.persistentVolume.size&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;20Gi,server.persistentVolume.size&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;20Gi
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;tekton&#34;&gt;Tekton&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tekton builds need to be configured to use PVCs bigger than 20Gi due to the same reasons. The default is to use 5GiB PVCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;cat &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; EOF | kubectl apply -f -
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;apiVersion: v1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;kind: ConfigMap
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;metadata:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;  name: config-artifact-pvc
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;  namespace: jx
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;data:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;  size: 20Gi
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;EOF&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Blog: DevOps World-Jenkins World 2019 San Francisco: Agenda is Live</title>
      <link>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2019/06/06/jenkins-world-agenda/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2019 12:20:42 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2019/06/06/jenkins-world-agenda/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/images/2019-dwjw-san-fran-rev.png&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cloudbees.com/devops-world/san-francisco&#34;&gt;DevOps World | Jenkins World&lt;/a&gt; is the largest Jenkins gathering of the year.  From August 12 - 15, 2019 the event will take place at the Moscone West Center in San Francisco.  The event boasts 100+ sessions, and will offer training, hands-on workshops, onsite certification, contributor summit and much more.  Conference attendees can expect to be inspired while learning the latest innovations from industry leaders. Attendees will learn the value that digital transformation has in delivering software more efficiently, more quickly and with higher quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are excited to announce most of the agenda for DevOps World | Jenkins World San Francisco is now live. We will continue to fill out the agenda with more sessions, trainings/workshops, and activities in the coming weeks. Below is a sampling of the Jenkins X sessions taking place at DevOps World | Jenkins World San Francisco:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous Delivery with Jenkins X Workshop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need a tool that will allow us to leverage all the latest and greatest processes and tools. At the same time, we need them to be simple and straightforward so that everyone can benefit from them. That is the primary objective behind the Jenkins X project. It brings power by combining best practices and tools while keeping it so simple that anyone can use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud Native CI/CD with Jenkins X and Tekton&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll explain the CI/CD challenges in a cloud native landscape, and show how Jenkins X rises to them by leveraging open source cloud native technologies like Tekton.  We will describe how the Jenkins X project has evolved on it&amp;rsquo;s own cloud native journey and the amazing benefits we are gaining by using the cloud well.  People who attend will leave with a better understanding of the awesome new technologies, architecture and benefits which are transforming the way we build, release, deploy and run our software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenkins X Optimized for GCP -  Craig Barber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X is an industry-wide leap forward to provide developers with a cloud native CI/CD experience. As the next evolution in the Jenkins space, Jenkins X redefines how CI/CD workloads run. In this talk, we will guide you on how to deploy, configure and use Jenkins X CI/CD pipelines within the Google Kubernetes Engine while taking full advantage of Jenkins X&amp;rsquo;s native integration with GCP&amp;rsquo;s industry leading services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrating JX (Serverless) with your Business&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CI/CD + GitOps is changing the way that we build software, it comes with a great cultural change and challenges but a lot of advantages. While using JX is an amazing starting point to get familiar with CI/CD and GitOps, companies can integrate with these tools in a whole new level to build the next generation SaaS offerings. In this presentation we will look at the Kubernetes Resources provided by JX and how can we integrate our own domain specific concepts to leverage JX from inside our services/products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See the full agenda &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.cvent.com/event/eac49765-9235-4b96-aaba-3bcb9cc837c3/websitePage:645d57e4-75eb-4769-b2c0-f201a0bfc6ce&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jenkins X creators and contributors will be onsite to mingle and answer any Jenkins X technical questions you might have.  Come if you are simply curious and just want to learn more or ask the experts those Jenkins X questions that has been keeping you up at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blog: Jenkins X joins the CDF</title>
      <link>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2019/03/09/jenkins-x-cdf/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 09 Mar 2019 07:36:00 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2019/03/09/jenkins-x-cdf/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;We are thrilled to announce that Jenkins X will be joining the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cd.foundation/&#34;&gt;Continuous Delivery Foundation&lt;/a&gt; as one of the founding projects.  The Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF) is a brand new sub-foundation of the Linux Foundation and will be dedicated to advancing the practice of continuous delivery and nurturing an ecosystem of interoperable tools for software delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/news/jenkins-x-cdf/cdf-stacked-color.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X is just over &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2019/01/14/happy-first-birthday/&#34;&gt;a year old&lt;/a&gt; but has been growing rapidly as the CI/CD solution for modern cloud applications on Kubernetes. Jenkins X automates CI+CD for Kubernetes using the best of breed OSS tools such as Jenkins, Tekton, Prow, Skaffold, Kaniko and Helm. The CDF will be a sibling foundation to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) which hosts Kubernetes amongst others. CDF will have its first event, CDF Summit, on May 20th alongside KubeCon Barcelona. We always love to work closely with other communities, and this will continue at scale within the CDF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m really excited to see the formation of the CDF - it&amp;rsquo;s starting with some of the most popular best-of-breed open source tools in the CI/CD space,&amp;rdquo; said James Strachan, co-founder of Jenkins X and distinguished engineer, CloudBees. &amp;ldquo;I’m looking forward to increased collaboration between us all to help accelerate the open source CI/CD landscape.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X started life under the Jenkins umbrella. In CDF, Jenkins X will be a distinct project from Jenkins which means some changes, such as having a Jenkins X Technical Steering Committee. These changes will happen gradually as we transition to CDF over the coming weeks. Normal development work will continue as usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are excited about all the new possibilities that being part of the CDF will bring. We look forward to new initiatives and welcoming everybody to &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/community/&#34;&gt;get involved with the project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2019/02/19/jenkins-x-next-gen-pipeline-engine/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Feb 2019 10:36:00 +0200</pubDate>

        &lt;h2 id=&#34;introducing-the-new-jenkins-x-pipeline-engine&#34;&gt;Introducing the new Jenkins X Pipeline Engine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/&#34;&gt;Jenkins X&lt;/a&gt; team and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cloudbees.com/&#34;&gt;CloudBees&lt;/a&gt; are excited to announce some changes that we’ve been working on and are jntroducing the new &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/architecture/jenkins-x-pipelines/&#34;&gt;Jenkins X Pipeline Engine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/EYywyqcPVMY?autoplay=1&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, there are two ways that you can run your Jenkins pipelines in Jenkins X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default today, Jenkins X uses a static traditional Jenkins master and Jenkins Pipelines. This mode works well for those who may have complex existing Jenkins pipelines and want to be able to use all the Jenkins X goodness of GitOps and preview environments in Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of last October, you can run Jenkins pipelines without the static Jenkins server &amp;ndash; so, it’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@jdrawlings/serverless-jenkins-with-jenkins-x-9134cbfe6870&#34;&gt;serverless&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serverless pipeline execution mode will become the best way to run Jenkins X in the not-too-distant future. And as we’re looking forward, we’ve begun to find ways to further improve the serverless mode of Jenkins X. We now have &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/architecture/jenkins-x-pipelines/&#34;&gt;Jenkins X Pipelines&lt;/a&gt; which are based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline&#34;&gt;Tekton&lt;/a&gt; which is a new Kubernetes-native way of running serverless pipelines. While it’s still in its early stages, Tekton will eventually become the best way to run CI/CD pipelines in Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve begun some early work to add Tekton into Jenkins X. You can now begin testing the pipeline, and we’d love to get your feedback. To use the new Tekton execution mode you &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/about/concepts/jenkins-x-pipelines/&#34;&gt;install your Jenkins X cluster using the new tekton mode&lt;/a&gt;. You will then get a &lt;code&gt;jenkins-x.yml&lt;/code&gt; file with your application instead of a Jenkinsfile in your source code repository. This YAML file is organized similarly to the Jenkins declarative pipeline syntax used in a Jenkinsfile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll continue to update the community on progress accordingly and welcome your feedback! Feel free to contact the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/community/#slack&#34;&gt;Jenkins X team via Slack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/community/#office-hours&#34;&gt;office hours&lt;/a&gt; or send us an email with any questions or concerns. The next office hours will be on Thursday, February 21st, at 11:00am ET and Andrew Bayer will be demoing progress. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blog: Happy 1st Birthday Jenkins X</title>
      <link>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2019/01/14/happy-first-birthday/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 14 Jan 2019 07:36:00 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2019/01/14/happy-first-birthday/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Time flies when you are delivering software. It has been just over a year since the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/commit/e255f7ea050c4a410a21183ec85a510c8e4ca8c6&#34;&gt;initial commit&lt;/a&gt; went into Github for Jenkins X, the CI/CD solution for cloud native. In just 12 months, Jenkins X progress has been breathtaking, so let’s celebrate by taking a look at all that has been accomplished in this short space of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/news/jenkins-x-first-birthday/birthday.jpg&#34;&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;One of the main founders of Jenkins X is &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jstrachan&#34;&gt;James Strachan&lt;/a&gt; of CloudBees, who is known for building many popular open source software projects such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://groovy-lang.org/index.html&#34;&gt;Apache Groovy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://camel.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Apache Camel&lt;/a&gt; and fabric8. Notable these projects also have enduring open source software communities around them. With all this experience it is safe to say James simply gets developers and what they want, need and care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers WANT to ship code fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers NEED to use best practices as they go so they can keep the long term sustainability of their code in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers CARE ABOUT what they are building; the code, the programming language, the environment, the quirks: everything that makes it special (and also makes one-size-fits-all tools impossible to build). Jenkins X gets all of this, let’s take a look at what it offers developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ship-code-fast&#34;&gt;Ship Code Fast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help developers get their code out to the world quickly Jenkins X offers preview environments, a seamless developer experience (DevEx) and support for multi-cloud platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;preview-environments&#34;&gt;Preview Environments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the Jenkins X killer feature. Preview environments enable developers to preview pull requests before changes merge to master. This takes away the pain of having to look at code to work out how good a PR is. Preview environments allow for fast and early feedback as developers can review actual functionality in an automatically provisioned environment. Typically the creation of preview environments is automated inside the Pipelines created by Jenkins X. Read more about &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/about/concepts/features/#preview-environments&#34;&gt;preview environments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;developer-experience-devex&#34;&gt;Developer Experience (DevEx)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X can provide preview environments and a complete system for scalable CI/CD because it builds on Kubernetes and the cloud native ecosystem (tools such as Helm). However Kubernetes is complex so Jenkins X abstracts away a lot of this complexity, for example by providing a one line &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/commands/jx_create_cluster/&#34;&gt;‘jx create cluster’&lt;/a&gt; command to create a fully formed cluster automatically set up with sensible defaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;multicloud&#34;&gt;Multicloud&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X can create a cluster with a single command on virtually any flavour of Kubernetes, either on prem or using a public cloud provider. Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, Oracle Cloud, IBM Cloud, RedHat Openshift and more are all supported. Jenkins X does the heavy lifting so developers can get started without needing to know the cloud-specific command line interface (CLI), how to set up role-based access (RBAC) or what ingress controllers are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;best-practices&#34;&gt;Best Practices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gitops&#34;&gt;GitOps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X comes built in with the most modern best practices for CI/CD including GitOps, operation by pull request. Jenkins X uses GitOps for promoting pull requests and to manage the configuration and version of the kubernetes resources which are deployed to each environment. Read &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/about/features/#environments&#34;&gt;more about GitOps here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;accelerate-capabilities&#34;&gt;Accelerate Capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X uses capabilities identified by the Accelerate book such as automating the deployment process, using trunk-based development and using loosely coupled architecture. Read &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/about/accelerate/&#34;&gt;more here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;extensibility&#34;&gt;Extensibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X works in different environments with any programming language and empowers developers to extend it in so it is optimized for their environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;quickstart-templates&#34;&gt;Quickstart templates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the most popular way to extend Jenkins X as the community have contributed many quickstart templates for their favourite programming languages and frameworks. Read more about &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/extending/&#34;&gt;extending Jenkins X&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;workloads&#34;&gt;Workloads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everybody has the luxury of starting on cloud native apps from fresh. so recently Jenkins X added buildpacks to bridge the cloud-native divide for typical Jenkins workloads such as Java, Maven, Gradle etc.. Buildpacks themselves are extensible. Read more about &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/architecture/build-packs/&#34;&gt;buildpacks here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-do-developer-think-of-jenkins-x&#34;&gt;What do developer think of Jenkins X?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the early adopters trying out Jenkins X we hear ‘Wow’ a lot, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Dailymotion wrote about how they went from &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/dailymotion/from-jenkins-to-jenkins-x-604b6cde0ce3&#34;&gt;Jenkins to Jenkins X&lt;/a&gt; they described the ‘wow effect’ of creating a cluster in one command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joselie Castañeda commented ‘take my wow!’ after watching the &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/uHe7R_iZSLU&#34;&gt;Jenkins X talk video from Kubecon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;community&#34;&gt;Community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X would not be where it is today without the lovely community who make lots of contributions: code contributions, giving feedback and even being good sports making the Jenkins X signal. Thank you all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenkins X is transforming the way developers continuously deliver code and we are excited to see how things progress in the next 12 months!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy first birthday Jenkins X!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@jdrawlings/&#34;&gt;James Rawlings&lt;/a&gt; has just published an excellent article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@jdrawlings/serverless-jenkins-with-jenkins-x-9134cbfe6870&#34;&gt;Serverless Jenkins with Jenkins X&lt;/a&gt; that is well worth a read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It describes how you can use it via the &lt;code&gt;--prow&lt;/code&gt; feature flag when using either &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/commands/jx_create_cluster/&#34;&gt;jx create cluster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;jx create cluster gke --prow
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/commands/deprecation/&#34;&gt;jx install&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;jx install --prow 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more details see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@jdrawlings/serverless-jenkins-with-jenkins-x-9134cbfe6870&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; or check out the video:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blog: Helm 2.x without Tiller</title>
      <link>https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2018/10/03/helm-without-tiller/</link>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-avoid-tiller&#34;&gt;How to avoid Tiller&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helm 2.x uses a server side component called &lt;em&gt;tiller&lt;/em&gt;. Typically Tiller is installed in a global namespace; or you can install a Tiller in each namespace and configure your &lt;code&gt;helm&lt;/code&gt; CLI to talk to the right tiller in the right namespace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However Tiller has a number of issues&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-problem-with-tiller&#34;&gt;The problem with Tiller&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;complicates RBAC since its not using the RBAC of the user or pod running the helm commands to read/write kubernetes resources - helm is talking to the remote tiller pod to do the work. If you are using a global tiller then thats often got something like the &lt;code&gt;cluster-admin&lt;/code&gt; role which means anyone running helm commands effectively side steps RBAC completely! :).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;helm forces all releases to have a unique name within a tiller. This means if you have one global tiller then each release name must be globally unique across all namespaces. This leads to very long release names since they must typically append the namespace too. This means often service names are very different between environments as the release name is often included in the service name in many charts which &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#discovering-services&#34;&gt;breaks lots of the promise of using canonical service discovery in kubernetes&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We prefer to use same service names in every environment (development, testing, staging, production) - to minimise the amount of per-environment configuration that is required which avoids manual effort and reduces errors. e.g. refer to http://my-service/ in your app and it should just work in every namespace/environment your app is deployed in without wiring up special configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can cause lots of version conflicts between helm clients + tiller versions. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen this a lot in Jenkins X this year. e.g. a user has, say, helm 2.9 installed locally and installs Jenkins X. Then a build pod with helm 2.10 runs and barfs as the tiller and helm versions don&amp;rsquo;t match.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;helm-3-will-be-tiller-less&#34;&gt;Helm 3 will be tiller-less&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever Helm 3 shows up Tiller will be a thing of the past - which is awesome - all of the above issues will be fixed! The only downside is no-one outside of Microsoft has any clue when Helm 3 will be a thing. Very little is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/helm/helm/tree/dev-v3&#34;&gt;happening on the public helm 3 branch&lt;/a&gt;, no &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/4255&#34;&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/4257&#34;&gt;pull requests&lt;/a&gt; are being accepted yet. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping there&amp;rsquo;s loads of activity on a private branch somewhere - but its probably a while away from being public and GA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;going-tiller-less-on-helm-2x&#34;&gt;Going tiller-less on Helm 2.x&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until Helm 3 the Jenkins X community needed a nice workaround for tiller on helm 2.x.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now if you want to use Jenkins X without tiller there&amp;rsquo;s a new magic command line argument &lt;code&gt;--no-tiller&lt;/code&gt; you can use when &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/getting-started/create-cluster/&#34;&gt;creating a cluster&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt; jx create cluster gke --no-tiller
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;or if you are &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/docs/resources/guides/managing-jx/old/install-on-cluster/&#34;&gt;installing on an existing kubernetes cluster&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt; jx install --no-tiller
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-does-it-work&#34;&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be able to change the helm behaviour via feature flags we abstracted away the low level calls to the helm CLI behind some &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/commands/jx_step_helm/&#34;&gt;jx step helm&lt;/a&gt; commands. e.g. to apply a helm chart in an environment pipeline we use&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;jx step helm apply
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lets us use feature flags to use different helm behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What &lt;code&gt;--no-tiller&lt;/code&gt;  means is to switch helm to use &lt;code&gt;template mode&lt;/code&gt; which means we no longer internally use &lt;code&gt;helm install mychart&lt;/code&gt; to install a chart, we actually use &lt;code&gt;helm template mychart&lt;/code&gt; instead which generates the YAML using the same helm charts and the standard helm confiugration management via &lt;code&gt;--set&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;values.yaml&lt;/code&gt; files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we use &lt;code&gt;kubectl apply&lt;/code&gt; to apply the YAML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we are using &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/about/concepts/features/#promotion&#34;&gt;GitOps&lt;/a&gt; in Jenkins X it turns out we don&amp;rsquo;t really need to rely on Helm&amp;rsquo;s use of kubernetes resources to store environment specific configuration values; since everything is already in git!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One added complication though is, with Helm you can add and remove resources inside a chart and as you upgrade to newer versions of the chart the old resources get automatically removed. Also with helm there&amp;rsquo;s a way to remove a release by name and all the resources are removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to preserve the helm semantics of removing old resources from a chart in newer versions (e.g. removing a microservice from the Staging environment) or removing an entire release we do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the YAML generated by&lt;code&gt;helm template&lt;/code&gt; is post processed to add 2 labels:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;metadata&lt;/span&gt;:
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;: mything
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;labels&lt;/span&gt;:
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;jenkins.io/chart-release&lt;/span&gt;: my-release
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;jenkins.io/version&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1.2.3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;after an upgrade we remove any resources for the same helm release name but different version (to remove any old resources) via the selector &lt;code&gt;jenkins.io/chart-release=my-release,jenkins.io/version!=1.2.3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to remove a release completely we just delete all resources with the label selector: &lt;code&gt;jenkins.io/chart-release=my-release&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;kustomize&#34;&gt;Kustomize?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One nice benefit of using &lt;code&gt;helm template&lt;/code&gt; to generate the YAML then using &lt;code&gt;kubectl apply&lt;/code&gt; means that we can look at optionally using tools like &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize&#34;&gt;kustomize&lt;/a&gt; post process the output of &lt;code&gt;helm template&lt;/code&gt; to allow resources to be overridden or enriched in ways that the chart author did not think of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-helm-feature-flags&#34;&gt;Other helm feature flags&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first experiment to remove tiller involved running the tiller process locally. We still have the feature flag &lt;code&gt;--remote-tiller=false&lt;/code&gt; which means that Jenkins X will ensure there&amp;rsquo;s a local &lt;code&gt;tiller&lt;/code&gt; process running and that the &lt;code&gt;helm&lt;/code&gt; CLI is pointed to the localhost port. This at least helps avoid the RBAC issues with tiller since the &lt;code&gt;tiller&lt;/code&gt; will be reusing the same RBAC rules as the caller of &lt;code&gt;helm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out this kinda works; though we found some issues around multi-team support so we ended up moving to the template mode described above which works much more reliably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another feature flag we added was allowing different helm binaries to be used; so that we could switch between, say, &lt;code&gt;helm&lt;/code&gt; for helm 2.x and &lt;code&gt;helm3&lt;/code&gt; for the 3.x version so that folks could experiment with alphas of helm 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though its looking like helm 3 is still some way off so its not recommended any time soon but as helm 3 gets near to RC stage we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to reuse the helm 3 feature flag again to let folks experiment with helm 3 until its GA and we make it the default in Jenkins X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use helm then we highly recommend you avoid tiller!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are using Jenkins X then please consider using the &lt;code&gt;--no-tiller&lt;/code&gt;  option when you&amp;rsquo;re &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/getting-started/create-cluster/&#34;&gt;creating a cluster&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/docs/resources/guides/managing-jx/old/install-on-cluster/&#34;&gt;install Jenkins X on an existing cluster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re working  on Jenkins X 2.0 - most of its features are already available hidden behind feature flags. So in Jenkins X 2.0 we will default disable tiller by default along with enabling other things like Prow integration and using &lt;em&gt;serverless&lt;/em&gt; Jenkins by default (more on those in a separate blog!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also really looking forward to helm 3! :). Helm rocks, but tiller does not!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be interactive Jenkins X demonstrations at the Jenkins X community booth and the exhibition theatre. There will be Jenkins X book signings and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://devopsworldjenkinsworld2018.sched.com/event/FYjb/building-continuous-delivery-for-microservices-with-jenkins-x-25?iframe=no&amp;amp;w=100%25&amp;amp;sidebar=yes&amp;amp;bg=no&#34;&gt;Jenkins X workshop&lt;/a&gt;, which is unfortunately already sold out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Strachan will be presenting &lt;a href=&#34;https://devopsworldjenkinsworld2018.sched.com/event/FlPE/jenkins-x-continuous-delivery-for-kubernetes?iframe=no&amp;amp;w=100%25&amp;amp;sidebar=yes&amp;amp;bg=no&#34;&gt;Jenkins X: Continuous Delivery for Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday 18 Sep&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and James Rawlings and Rob Davies will be presenting &lt;a href=&#34;https://devopsworldjenkinsworld2018.sched.com/event/GFmE/extending-jenkins-x-for-fun-and-profit?iframe=no&amp;amp;w=100%25&amp;amp;sidebar=yes&amp;amp;bg=no&#34;&gt;Extending Jenkins X for fun&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday 18 Sep too&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jenkins X team is looking forward to seeing you at Jenkins World this year!&lt;/p&gt;

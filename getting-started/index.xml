      <description>Knowing where to start is often the hardest thing. To assist, we&amp;rsquo;ve created a constantly evolving set of tutorials that can be used against Google Kubernetes Engine utilising its Google Cloud Shell feature to help you get up and running quickly.
Installing JX on GKE Time to complete. About 25 minutes
At the end of this guide you will have:
 a working JX installation on Google Kubernetes Engine created an application using a quickstart promoted that application to production</description>

      <description>Pick the most suitable instructions for your operating system:
macOS On a Mac you can use brew:
brew tap jenkins-x/jx brew install jx  Or if you have not installed brew and prefer to install by hand:
curl -L https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/download/v1.3.502/jx-darwin-amd64.tar.gz | tar xzv sudo mv jx /usr/local/bin Linux mkdir -p ~/.jx/bin curl -L https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/download/v1.3.502/jx-linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar xzv -C ~/.jx/bin export PATH=$PATH:~/.jx/bin echo &amp;#39;export PATH=$PATH:~/.jx/bin&amp;#39; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/.bashrc Windows If you use Chocolatey, then there is a package available.</description>

      <title>Create new Cluster</title>
      <link>https://jenkins-x.io/getting-started/create-cluster/</link>

      <description>To create a new Kubernetes cluster with Jenkins X installed use the jx create cluster command.
A number of different public cloud providers are supported as shown below.
For the best getting started experience we currently recommend using Google Container Engine (GKE). The Google Cloud Platform offers a $300 free credit if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a Google Cloud account. See https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial
Here&amp;rsquo;s a little demo showing GKE, AKS and Minikube in parallel.</description>

      <title>Install on Kubernetes</title>
      <link>https://jenkins-x.io/getting-started/install-on-cluster/</link>

      <description>Jenkins X can be installed on 1.8 or later of Kubernetes. The requirements are:
 RBAC is enabled your kubernetes cluster has a default storage class setup so that Persistent Volume Claims can be bound to Persistent Volumes If not using the aws or eks providers then we need insecure docker registries are enabled. This is so that pipelines can use a docker registry running inside the kubernetes cluster (which typically is not public so no https support).</description>

      <title>What happens during installation</title>

      <description>The Jenkins X CLI will do the following when installing the Jenkins X platform:
Install client binaries to manage your cluster  If you are running on Mac OS X, Jenkins X is using Homebrew to install the various CLI. It will install it if not present.
  Install kubectl kubectl is the CLI of Kubernetes. It allows you to interact with your Kubernetes cluster via the API server.</description>

      <guid>https://jenkins-x.io/getting-started/next/</guid>
      <description>OK so you have got the jx CLI and you either
 created a Kubernetes cluster with Jenkins X installed Jenkins X on an existing kubernetes cluster  So whats next?
Well the Developing section contains the next steps you may want to try out, such as
 create a new Spring Boot application and import it into Jenkins X create a new quickstart and import it into Jenkins X import existing source code into Jenkins X browsing for browsing pipelines, builds, apps and activity  You may also want to check out the various demonstrations of what you can do with Jenkins X</description>

      <title>Configuration</title>
      <link>https://jenkins-x.io/getting-started/config/</link>

      <guid>https://jenkins-x.io/getting-started/config/</guid>
      <description>Jenkins X should work out of the box with smart defaults for your cloud provider. e.g. Jenkins X automatically uses ECR if you are using AWS or EKS.
However you can configure values in the underlying helm charts used by Jenkins X.
To do this you need to create a myvalues.yaml file in the current directory you are in when you run either jx create cluster or jx install</description>

      <title>Create custom Builder</title>

      <description>In Jenkins X, it is possible to create your custom Builders (aka POD templates) or overwrite existing onces. You just need to base your Docker image on this builder-base image or on its slim version. These images contain a number of pre-installed tools which get constantly updated and published to Docker Hub.
Create a custom Builder from scratch Builder image First you need to create a docker image for your builder.</description>
